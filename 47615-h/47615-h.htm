<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I<br/>THE STRANGE RETURN OF OLD BALDY</h2>

<p>“Did you find your knife, Bob?”</p>

<p>“No such good luck, Frank.”</p>

<p>“That’s kind of queer, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I’m beginning to think so myself,” and Bob
Archer looked meaningly at his chum, as though
a suspicion might be forming in his mind to the
effect that there was a practical joke back of it all;
and that Frank Haywood really knew more about
the missing article than he chose to admit.</p>

<p>And yet, Frank, as a rule, was not given to
pranks.</p>

<p>“Did you go all over the ground where Ted
Conway was teaching you yesterday how to pick
up a handkerchief from the back of a galloping
pony?” Frank continued.</p>

<p>“Covered every foot of it, and more,” replied
Bob.</p>

<p>“And still didn’t find the knife you value so
much?” persisted his chum.</p>

<p>“Never saw a sign of it,” replied Bob; whose
home had originally been in Old Kentucky, although
a year or so back he had come to the<!-- 007.png -->
Southwest to live, his father being interested in
various ranches and mines with Colonel Leonidas
Haywood.</p>

<p>“Oh! well, I wouldn’t worry about it too
much,” observed Frank. “It’s sure to turn up,
sooner or later. Perhaps one of the boys happened
to pick it up, and is waiting for an owner to
claim it.”</p>

<p>“I asked every one on the ranch,” Bob went
on, gloomily; “and they all had the same story to
tell—never saw the thing. I hate to have anything
like that happen. Seems as if I feel every
little while that it’s on the tip of my tongue to say
what I did with that knife. Then I get all mixed
up again, and for the life of me I can’t remember
where and when I had it last.”</p>

<p>The two boys, while talking in this manner,
were galloping over the level plain at a fair clip.
Bob was riding Domino, a big black horse he had
brought with him from the blue grass region of
Kentucky. Frank rode a yellow pony of great
endurance, and wise beyond the average of his
class. Buckskin he was called, true to his color;
and Frank had taught him many of the tricks
known to the favorite mounts of cowboys.</p>

<p>Frank and Bob were seen riding over the country
so much, that, far and wide, they had become
known as the “Saddle Boys.” Some months before
the time when they are introduced to the<!-- 008.png -->
reader in the present volume they had investigated
a mysterious noise that seemed to come from a
spur of the great Rocky Mountains within twenty
miles of Circle Ranch.</p>

<p>This queer rumbling had awed the Indians for a
century or more, and they really believed it to be
the voice of Manitou. What the two lads saw,
and the adventures that befell them on that occasion,
have been related in the first story in this
series, entitled: “The Saddle Boys in the Rockies;
Or, Lost on Thunder Mountain.”</p>

<p>Later on, a sudden call came for them to go to
the wonderful region where the great Colorado
River runs for some hundreds of miles through
the most astonishing canyon in all the world; and
here they not only saw strange sights, but had
some lively times. These are narrated in the
story called: “The Saddle Boys in the Grand
Canyon; Or, The Hermit of Echo Cave.”</p>

<p>Colonel Haywood was laid up with a broken
leg when a summons came that required his presence
at Cherry Blossom mine, so he was compelled
to ask the two boys to go in his stead. This mine
was a most valuable property; and the disaster
that hung over it like a cloud gave the two lads
considerable work before they could feel that they
had won out. The remarkable things that happened
when on this gallop over plain and desert,
and through mountain trails are told of in the<!-- 009.png -->
third book of this series, entitled: “The Saddle
Boys on the Plains; Or, After a Treasure of
Gold.”</p>

<p>After passing through these troubles of magnitude,
here was Bob bemoaning the loss of a knife,
as though such a little thing distressed him beyond
measure.</p>

<p>“It was a present, you see, Frank,” he said,
for perhaps the tenth time, as they rode along side
by side.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes. I know,” replied Frank, as though
really getting quite tired of hearing about that
wonderful knife; “some girl you knew in Old
Kentucky, wanting to give you a present that you
could use out in the wild and woolly West, drew
all her pin money she had saved, and actually
bought you that fine hunting knife. Too bad that
if it was so valuable you didn’t keep a closer
watch on it, Bob.”</p>

<p>“But you said <i>you</i> didn’t have it, didn’t you,
Frank?” went on the other.</p>

<p>“Sure I haven’t; take my word for that, Bob,”
said Frank. “Don’t you think I’d give it to
you, if I had it around? Though, for that matter,
I think you deserve to be punished a little for
being so careless about a present that a girl gave
you.”</p>

<p>“But perhaps you could give me a hint about
what I did with it, if you cared to, Frank?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe I could,” replied the other,
slowly, and in what Bob chose to consider a suspicious
way. “You’ll remember after a little.
Perhaps it’ll pop into your mind as you wake up
in the morning. I’ve had things do that more’n
a few times. But look at that steer cavorting
around over yonder. Whatever in the world do
you suppose he’s doing, Bob?”</p>

<p>The Kentucky boy shook his head as though
still unsatisfied.</p>

<p>“I reckon now, Frank might know a little about
that knife,” he murmured to himself, as he looked
at his chum. “But for some reason he wants to
play innocent and let me think things out. And
it isn’t like Frank, to act this way. Perhaps
I’d best keep quiet, and watch him. He might
give himself away somehow when he isn’t on his
guard.”</p>

<p>Frank, meanwhile, seemed to be really interested
in the actions of the animal to which he had
called the attention of his chum.</p>

<p>“Say, suppose we turn aside here,” he remarked,
presently; “and go a little closer to that
old chap. Looks to me he’s acting mighty queer.
See him throw up the dirt; and I can hear him
bellow from here. Something’s made him ugly.”</p>

<p>“All right; anything you say goes, Frank,” replied
the other, suiting his actions to his words,
and wheeling to the left.<!-- 011.png --></p>

<p>For the time being he put all thought of the
missing present from his mind. Just as Frank
had said, the chances were he would find it again,
sooner or later. Yet Bob admitted to himself
that it had been a long time since anything had
arisen to annoy him so much.</p>

<p>They were now bearing down upon the spot
where the steer was acting so strangely. He
circled around a small patch of timber and
brush that was too dense for him to push through,
every little while bellowing angrily, shaking his
long horns, and giving every evidence of having
been worked up to a pitch where he could not contain
himself.</p>

<p>“Strikes me he’s keeping close to that <i>motte</i> of
timber, Frank?” suggested Bob, as they kept galloping
closer to the spot.</p>

<p>“Just what I had in mind,” replied his chum.</p>

<p>“Look at him behaving as if he’d give anything
to be able to rush it; but no long-horn could push
through that thick scrub. There’s something in
the bunch that makes him furious, that’s what,
Frank!” went on Bob.</p>

<p>“Reckon you’re right, Bob; anyhow that’s what
I was thinking myself.”</p>

<p>“Could it be a rattler?” asked the Kentucky
lad.</p>

<p>“Well, now, I hardly think a steer would act
that way if it was,” replied the youth who had<!-- 012.png -->
been brought up on a ranch, and knew a great
many things that were as yet mysterious to a recent
tenderfoot like Bob. “In the open, some steers
might try and jump on a snake that was coiled,
just as I’ve seen a deer do more’n once, grinding
it to pieces under his hoofs. But if the snake
got in among the brush, a steer would let him go.”</p>

<p>“Then what can it be?” queried the boy from
Kentucky; “a sneaking coyote?”</p>

<p>“Hardly that, either,” declared his chum, decidedly.
“You see these old steers size up a coyote
as a harmless thing, not worth wasting time
over. Now, if it were a wolf that would be another
thing. A steer hates a mountain wolf like
poison. Seems like they know how the gray rascal
is always hanging around, waiting to pull down
a calf when the chance comes.”</p>

<p>“So I’ve been told,” declared Bob; “Ted related
an instance where a steer and a wolf had a
battle over the body of a heifer the robber had
stolen.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I happened to see that fight; and the
steer won out, too. The wolf was as mad as they
make ’em, and wouldn’t quit. He grabbed the
steer several times by the nose, but couldn’t hold
on. And finally the steer managed to pin him to
the ground by one horn. After that it was all
over with Mr. Wolf.”</p>

<p>“But see here, Frank, supposing there is a wolf<!-- 013.png -->
in that bunch of timber and scrub? He’s been
sneaking around, thinking to get a dinner while
the cowboys are away on the other side of the
ranch, twenty miles from here. But a wolf can
outrun even the fastest steer, can’t he?”</p>

<p>“I reckon he can, every time,” admitted Frank.</p>

<p>“Then why wouldn’t this beast make for his
home in the mountains; tell me that, please?”
persisted Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh! there might be a reason,” his chum rejoined,
as he continued to watch the actions of
the steer. “In the first place, this might happen
to be a particularly bold wolf; and having started
out to get a dinner, he hates to give up the idea
just because a silly old steer prances around his
hiding place, and dares him to come out into the
open.”</p>

<p>“But there might be another reason?” pursued
Bob, always eager to learn.</p>

<p>“If it is a wolf,” Frank continued; “he might
happen to be lame, and not feel like taking chances
on the open with a lively old steer. That would
explain it, you see.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, we’ll soon know, Frank.”</p>

<p>“Yes, because we’re nearly there,” the other
remarked, as he reached around to unfasten his
repeating rifle from the saddle, where he often
carried it, rather than over his back by means of
a strap.<!-- 014.png --></p>

<p>“And before we leave here it’s going to be a
hard winter for Mr. Wolf, if that’s what’s making
the trouble. If he runs, the steer will catch up
with him; and if he stays, it’s a bit of lead between
his ribs. I’m sorry for him, Frank; but I reckon
he’s been responsible for more than a few heifers
that have disappeared mysteriously from time to
time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so,” replied Frank. “Stockmen
hate wolves more’n anything on four legs.
There’s only one thing that hits ’em worse.”</p>

<p>“Rustlers, you mean, Frank?” remarked the
Kentucky boy.</p>

<p>“Yes, the Mexicans or halfbreeds, who drop
down on a herd of cattle, or the saddle band of
the punchers’ horses, and disappear with them.
And of all the rustlers in Arizona, there’s none
equal to Pedro Mendoza. Look at the steer,
Bob!”</p>

<p>“Seems to just know we’re coming to lend a
helping hand,” laughed Bob. “There he gallops
around to the other side of the timber, as if he
wanted to cut off Mr. Wolf before he took a
start from that side. He’s a sharp one, that
steer.”</p>

<p>“None smarter, and I ought to know, because
that’s Old Baldy!” remarked Frank.</p>

<p>“What!” cried Bob, “didn’t you tell me a
long time ago that Old Baldy had been nipped,
with a bunch of cattle; and your foreman believed
the rustlers had him?”</p>

<p>“That’s what we felt sure of, and I believe it
yet,” Frank said. “But all the same, I don’t
think I’m mistaken when I say that’s our Old
Baldy, come back as straight as he disappeared.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he broke out of some corral in the
mountains, where the rustlers were keeping him
penned up, and took the home trail on the gallop,”
suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” Frank remarked. “Later on we’ll
see if his brand has been altered, because that
would tell the story. But turn off here, Bob, and
let’s cover as much ground as we can. Have
your gun handy; and if the wolf vamooses, give
him a little start. Then we’ll have a bully gallop,
and see who will be the first to nail him. Whoop!
there’s something doing right now, Bob!”</p>
</div>

<div id='chII' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER II<br/>ONE GRAY THIEF LESS</h2>

<p>“There he goes; and it is a wolf, sure pop,
Frank!” shouted Bob.</p>

<p>“And if you look close,” remarked his chum,
“you’ll see that he wobbles just a little with that
left hind leg of his. Reckon he got a thorn in his
paw, or cut it on a sharp rock. After him, Bob!”</p>

<p>They gave the horses free rein. Both animals
were comparatively fresh, and eager for a mad
gallop over the open country that cool day in
the Fall.</p>

<p>The steer did not seem to have sighted the
fleeing wolf, or else must have decided that, with
the two mounted boys in swift pursuit, there was
little need of his exerting himself to overtake
the hated enemy. At any rate he remained in
the vicinity of the timber, as though bent on keeping
the animal from again seeking refuge there.</p>

<p>“He’s heading for that swale near the rocky
point; and if he reaches it we’ll have a hard time
getting him!” exclaimed Bob, after a few minutes
of racing.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, he isn’t going to get there,”
said Frank; “because we’re overhauling him
right now. Look at him run! Lame or not, he
can lope along as well as any wolf I ever chased.
He knows he’s running for his life, the sly varmint.
And he has hopes of giving us the slip.”</p>

<p>“I can see him look back every little while,
Frank,” Bob remarked, as he bent low in the
saddle, and felt his pulses thrill with the excitement
of the chase. “What do you suppose he
does that for?”</p>

<p>“Looking for the flash of the smoke of a gun,
perhaps,” came the reply. “Some of these old
prowlers are as wise as they make ’em. The
boys declare they can dodge a bullet, if they happen
to be looking back when you fire. Remember
that, Bob, and be ready to shoot at the drop
of the hat after I’ve let loose. Perhaps we can
catch him napping that way.”</p>

<p>Bob was aware that he had much to learn about
shooting while on the full gallop. Still, he would
like to make a try. If he failed, then rather than
see the wolf escape, he meant to be the one to
take first shot, and let Frank try to nip the gray
robber of the herds before he could recover.</p>

<p>Already had they decreased by one-half and
more the lead with which the fleeing animal had
started. Things were getting serious with the
wolf now. His observations became more frequent.
Evidently he expected that at any moment<!-- 018.png -->
firing might begin; and he wanted to be
ready to dodge.</p>

<p>“How about it now, Frank?” asked the Kentucky
boy, as he held his rifle in readiness for instant
use.</p>

<p>“We might give him a try,” came the reply;
and as he spoke Frank threw his gun up to his
shoulder, allowing the bridle to fall upon the
neck of Buckskin.</p>

<p>The sharp report of the weapon sounded; but
apparently there was no result. Quickly, after the
first shot, came a second. Bob had pulled trigger,
too; but the fleeing wolf did not show the
least sign of having been struck.</p>

<p>“I missed him clean, Frank!” cried Bob, in
dismay. “Hardly thought I’d be smart enough
to hit such a flying target while going at this pace.
But Frank, you were right; I plainly saw him
dodge when you shot!”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s give him another round then, and
see if you can do better, Bob.”</p>

<p>“I’m ready; let him have it,” yelled Bob,
eagerly, his sporting instinct now fully aroused.</p>

<p>Again did Frank fire; and, seeing that the gray
animal was still bounding along uninjured, Bob
in turn discharged his gun.</p>

<p>“Poor shooting; that’s what!” he exclaimed;
“I mean mine, of course, Frank; and now, you’ve
just got to take your turn.”</p>

<p>“If you say so, all right!” answered the other.</p>

<p>“Something ought to be done, because we’re
getting closer to that swale all the time; and I
say it’d be a shame if the old wolf got clean away
through trickery. Ready, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Let her go!”</p>

<p>Bob took a quick aim at the animal, and fired.
Of course he had not the remotest idea of hitting
the wolf; but by causing him to dodge it would
open the way for his more experienced chum to
get in a shot when the beast was off his guard.</p>

<p>The report of Frank’s gun came so close upon
that of his own that Bob could hardly believe
there had been two shots. Yet he had seen that
the wolf kept on after his discharge. It was different
when Frank shot his bolt.</p>

<p>“Wow! you got him that time, Frank!”
shouted Bob, with great glee. “He’s dropped in
his tracks, as sure as anything. Tried that trick
just once too often, didn’t he? Look at him
kicking his last! He’s paying now for the veal
he carried off all these years, the villain!”</p>

<p>Frank laughed, for he felt particularly well
pleased because the wolf had been kept from
reaching the rocks where he might have eluded
them.</p>

<p>They drew rein, and looked down at the now
motionless form of the gaunt animal. Even in
death the big wolf had a sinister appearance, for<!-- 020.png -->
the lips were drawn back, exposing his cruel fangs.</p>

<p>“Ugh! I’d hate to meet a critter like that
alone, and without more’n a knife to defend myself
with, Frank!” Bob exclaimed, as he sat
in the saddle, pushing several cartridges into the
magazine of his rifle, and looking down at the
hated quarry that had rewarded Frank’s last
shot.</p>

<p>“Oh! he’s an old one, all right,” remarked
Frank. “I can see the scars of many a fight on
his hide, and about his muzzle. But wait till I
fling him across the horse. Watch Buckskin
prance! No horse likes to come in touch with a
wild animal like a panther, wolf or bear, dead or
alive. The scent of blood makes ’em wild, too.
Whoa! Buckskin! don’t be so funny now.
You’ve just got to carry this chap back to the
ranch, because I want dad to see him.”</p>

<p>“Then we head toward home, now?” remarked
Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, but by way of that timber. I want to
take a look at Old Baldy. When the boys hear
of his return, there’ll be some tall talking. He
used to give heaps of trouble in the past; yet they
all liked the old chap. And when he disappeared,
in company with a dozen head of stock, there was
more range riding to find him than I ever heard
of.”</p>

<p>“Old Baldy is waiting for us,” remarked Bob.
“Seems like he just knew what we went for, and
he wants to see what luck we had.”</p>

<p>“He’s a smart one, all right,” laughed Frank.
“And if those rustlers have had him penned up
all this while, he’s managed to break out at last,
and come home.”</p>

<p>“Say, wouldn’t it be a great stunt now, if
some of the boys could follow his trail back to
Where he was kept in a corral. That would tell
us, Frank, just how Pedro Mendoza manages to
disappear, whenever he runs a bunch of cattle
off.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps it might be done yet, impossible
as it seems,” observed Frank.</p>

<p>“What makes you say so?” demanded the
other.</p>

<p>“You see, Old Baldy has a marked hoof,”
Frank went on.</p>

<p>“Different from those of other steers, you
mean?” asked his chum.</p>

<p>“Yes. It’s got a queer twist that makes it
look much longer than his other hoofs. The boys
all know it, too. Spanish Joe used to say the
animal must have got caught in a cleft of the
rocks when small, and his hoof grew that way.”</p>

<p>“But, Frank, could any cowboy track Old
Baldy all the way across plain and desert to the
mountains, if he came from there, perhaps all of
forty miles?”</p>

<p>“Under ordinary conditions I’d say no,”
Frank answered promptly; “but you remember
that we had a rain two days ago, which is quite
remarkable for this country. That laid the alkali
dust; and eyes trained to that sort of thing might
do wonders. But that we’ll have to put up to
dad and Bart Heminway, the foreman of Circle
Ranch.”</p>

<p>“Here’s Old Baldy, looking to see if you got
the wolf,” remarked Bob.</p>

<p>The gaunt-looking old steer did indeed seem
to be beset with curiosity. Standing there, with
head thrust out, he was sniffing the air, as though
possibly the scent of blood came to his nostrils.
Frank tossed the body of the wolf down on the
ground, and then with his chum rode back a little
distance to see what the steer would do.</p>

<p>“Watch!”</p>

<p>“He’s going up to smell of the wolf, Frank!”
exclaimed the Kentucky boy.</p>

<p>“That’s what he is!” echoed Frank, as he
watched the big beast approach, and finally bend
his horned head to sniff at the gray-coated robber
who had, in times past, stolen many a calf, and
partly grown heifer, from the herd, as the animals
grazed in some dangerous spot.</p>

<p>“How about the brand; has it been changed?”
asked Bob, seeing the flank of the returned steer
turned toward them.<!-- 023.png --></p>

<p>“It’s been burned out entirely; but no new one
made yet,” Frank replied.</p>

<p>“How was that, do you suppose, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Old Baldy was too much for the
Mexican ropers,” the other answered; “and they
just had to give up the idea of putting another
brand on him. Then again, if Spanish Joe or his
nephew Abajo happened to be in the bunch of
rustlers, they would recognize Old Baldy, and
warn the others that it would be dangerous to try
and slip him through. No matter, here he is,
right side up with care, and as ready as ever to do
battle.”</p>

<p>“Look at him going to horn the dead wolf,”
said Bob. “He’ll spoil the skin for you, Frank,
if you don’t watch out.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t care much about that,” Frank
remarked; “because it’s an old and sunburned
pelt at best; but I’d like dad to see the thief intact.
So let’s ride forward, and induce Old Baldy to
stop his sport.”</p>

<p>The steer retreated at their advance, still shaking
his head threateningly, as though not quite
convinced that he had better keep the peace.
Possibly he recognized Frank as an old acquaintance,
and was so rejoiced to be back again amid
the associations of his earlier years that he decided
not to attack them. Had he tried anything
of the sort he would have rued the day, because<!-- 024.png -->
Frank could throw the rope as well as any cowboy,
and he would speedily have rolled Old Baldy
over on his back.</p>

<p>Once again the dead wolf was tossed across
the back of the plunging buckskin pony. No
matter how well trained a horse may be, he will
never become accustomed to the presence of a
beast of prey. Even circus horses show their
nervousness, after drawing a cage containing a
tiger or a lion for weeks and months at a time.</p>

<p>Old Baldy trotted along after them as they
rode off.</p>

<p>“That proves he was on his way home when
he scented that lame wolf; and perhaps chased
him into that bunch of timber,” remarked Frank,
as he turned in the saddle and saw the following
steer.</p>

<p>They soon sighted the white-washed buildings
of Circle Ranch. Trees gave a grateful shade in
places; but from far off on the plain a traveler
could catch glimpses of the home of the Haywoods,
and the headquarters of the largest stock-growers
in all Arizona.</p>

<p>When the two boys drew up in front of the
ranch house they found Frank’s father sitting in
a chair on the piazza. He had not as yet fully
recovered from his broken leg.</p>

<p>“Hello! Frank, back again so soon?” he called
out, as the boys drew rein and jumped to the<!-- 025.png -->
ground. “What brought you back in such a
hurry? And it seemed to me I heard some sort
of firing away out to windward. Was that
you?”</p>

<p>“Just what it was, dad,” replied Frank. “We
were chasing a wolf, and trying to beat him at
dodging. He was an old chap; but after a few
trials we knocked him over; and he’ll never pull
down another calf for us.”</p>

<p>“I wish we could get rid of all our troubles as
easily as that, Frank,” remarked Colonel Haywood,
as he glanced at the dead animal which
his boy dragged up near the steps of the
piazza.</p>

<p>“We never would have seen him, I reckon,
sir,” Bob spoke, “only for a steer that had him
cornered in a little bunch of timber and brush, and
was daring him to come out. Frank guessed the
wolf might be a little lame, which was why he
didn’t appear. That proved to be so when we
scared him into running. But Frank nailed him,
all right, you may be sure—caught him just back
of the foreleg, when he turned aside at my shot.
It’s a trick I hope to learn some day.”</p>

<p>“So a steer held him up, eh?” went on the
stockman. “It isn’t often any of them will do
that, Frank.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can expect anything of Old
Baldy!” remarked Frank, quietly.<!-- 026.png --></p>

<p>The stockman started, and showed great interest.</p>

<p>“What’s that, Frank?” he exclaimed. “Old
Baldy come back again, after we believed the
rustlers got him? That’s some interesting news,
now. The boys will be tickled to know that.
And perhaps Old Baldy may help us locate Mendoza
the Rustler’s secret corral!”</p>

<div id='chIII' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER III<br/>THE ALARM BELL</h2>

<p>“How long has Old Baldy been gone now,
dad?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“All of a month, I’m positive,” replied the
stockman. “Yes, I remember now that we
missed a round dozen head at the time, followed
their tracks for several miles, and then they
seemed to disappear in the low swale back of
Purple Sage Mesa. We never got a trace of
them again. Some of the boys jumped to the
conclusion that they were caught in that quicksand.
But I never could quite believe Old Baldy would
forget all his cunning like that.”</p>

<p>“You’ve always stuck to it that the bunch was
driven off by men cunning enough to hide their
trail, haven’t you, dad?” Frank continued.</p>

<p>“That’s what I have,” said Colonel Haywood,
emphatically; “and now that you tell me
the old fellow has shown up again, I’m more set
on that explanation than ever.”</p>

<p>“There’s proof that Old Baldy has been in<!-- 028.png -->
other hands all this time,” remarked Frank, nodding
his head convincingly.</p>

<p>“You mean his brand has been changed?” exclaimed
the stockman, eagerly. “Perhaps that
ought to tell us who took him. I hope, son, you
haven’t found the Arrow brand there, nor yet the
mark of the X—bar—X Syndicate? I’d hate to
think any decent rancher could be guilty of such
a thing, for spite!”</p>

<p>“Fact is, dad,” laughed Frank, “there isn’t a
sign of a new mark on the flank of Old Baldy.
Somebody took the pains to wipe out our brand,
all right; but they didn’t have the nerve to continue
the work. I reckon that Old Baldy just
tore around, so they had to let him severely
alone.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t wonder,” chuckled the
stockman, who had known the tough old steer to
do many queer things in his time. “Only wonder
is they didn’t put a bullet in him, and end his
loping. But I must go out and see our old friend
when he shows up. You think he was on the
way here, don’t you, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Sure he was,” continued the boy, “when he
caught a whiff of that lame wolf, and set up a
siege by the little bunch of timber. Give him half
an hour, and you’ll see him show up at the cattle
corral, acting just as if he’d never been away.”</p>

<p>“There’ll be some high old jinks played<!-- 029.png -->
around there,” remarked Bob. “Old Baldy
used to be the Great Mogul, I remember; and
since he disappeared several candidates have
bobbed up to take his place.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’ll have to beat the lot of ’em before
he’s proved his right to his old position of boss!”
declared Frank.</p>

<p>“And he’ll sure do it,” echoed Bob. “The
way he acted out there on the plain proved that
even a month’s vacation hasn’t taken any of the
ginger and spirit out of the old chap. Why, I
guess he’s that tough, his flesh would turn the
edge of a hunting knife—that is, any ordinary
blade,” and Bob sighed as he spoke.</p>

<p>Frank knew that he was thinking once more of
the mystery concerning the disappearance of his
own knife, which he valued so highly, and thought
without an equal.</p>

<p>Some of the cowboys connected with the Circle
Ranch came galloping in just then. They were
grinning, as though wonderfully pleased over
something; a fact the boys with Colonel Haywood
noticed immediately.</p>

<p>“Two to one they’re on,” remarked Bob, upon
seeing the three punchers make a bee-line for the
piazza, as though each wanted to be the first to
communicate some pleasing information.</p>

<p>“He come back, Colonel!” yelled one, from
afar.<!-- 030.png --></p>

<p>“It’s that sly Old Baldy, he means!” called a
second.</p>

<p>“Thar he is, headin’ for the corral right
now!” whooped the third, not wanting to be left
entirely out of the game.</p>

<p>“An’ our brand’s been burned off, sure,” declared
the leader, as he reached the steps; “but
thar, ye don’t seem to be s’prised a heap. Boys,
it ain’t no news after all, we’re slinging. Look
at Frank grin; it’s a cinch he’s been ahead of
us!”</p>

<p>Of course, after that, Frank had to own up, and
relate the story of how Old Baldy had made the
lame wolf take to cover, and held him there until
help came.</p>

<p>“Bully for Old Baldy! He’s the same game
chap as before he was took!” exclaimed Jeff
Davis; and then led his comrades in a series
of cheers for the returned wanderer who had
finally made his way home, after adventures
which might never be more than guessed at.</p>

<p>An exciting debate followed; but when all had
given their opinion it was found that suspicion
centred on Pedro Mendoza as the guilty one.
This Mexican had long been a thorn in the flesh
of the ranchers of Arizona. He led a band of
bold, lawless spirits who seemed able to appear
and vanish in a manner that baffled all search.</p>

<p>As a rule the rustlers had not annoyed the Circle<!-- 031.png -->
Ranch people, confining their operations to
ranges more distant. Nevertheless, the stockmen
had grumbled considerably about the way
these frequent outrages took away from the
profits of raising cattle; and, only for the petty
jealousies between them, they must have united
long ago in a determined effort to rid the country,
once and for all, of such a bad character as Mendoza.</p>

<p>Colonel Haywood and his foreman had often
talked the matter over. They had even laid out
a plan of campaign to be followed in case they
awoke some morning to find that the rustlers had
visited the herds of Circle Ranch.</p>

<p>At the time the dozen head had vanished, Old
Baldy among them, opinions had differed so widely
that nothing was done. Since no trail could be
found beyond a certain point the boys had concluded
that the quicksand was responsible for the
wholesale disappearance. At other times a single
cow had been engulfed; and, on the face of it, this
theory appeared plausible; though Colonel Haywood
had never been fully convinced himself concerning
its truth.</p>

<p>But at the time he had been laid up with a
broken leg; and as he would wish to be at the
head of any expedition formed for the purpose
of hunting the shrewd rustlers to their hiding
place, it was finally allowed to drop.<!-- 032.png --></p>

<p>But the anger of the Circle Ranch cow punchers
only slept. The return of Old Baldy with the
mark of a fresh burn on his flank, blotting out
the circle that had stamped him as the property
of Colonel Haywood, was the match that once
more started the smouldering blaze.</p>

<p>There was more or less excited talk in the bunk-house
that night concerning the necessity for some
prompt action with regard to ridding the country
of the rustlers who had so long had things their
own way.</p>

<p>Even the stockman seemed to have the subject
on his mind, for as he sat with the two boys and
Bart Heminway on the piazza after supper, with
the moon just rising in the eastern heavens, and
the many noises of the night adding to the drowsy
feeling, he referred to the loss of the entire saddle
band of horses, sustained by a ranch located some
twenty miles away, on Cibiou Creek.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking some over that matter,
Frank,” he continued; “while I was kept here
idle with this game leg; and putting this and that
together, I reached a certain conclusion. Fact is,
I’ve about made up my mind I know where that
Mendoza crowd of rustlers must hold out.”</p>

<p>“If that’s so, dad,” remarked Frank, “you’d
sure please a lot of people a heap if you could
show ’em. They’ve been hunting high and low
these three years and more for that secret cache<!-- 033.png -->
where Pedro hides his stolen cattle and horses.
Would you mind telling Bob and me about it?”</p>

<p>“Fact is, Frank,” the rancher went on, “you
were the one to give me my idea.”</p>

<p>“Now I get on to what you mean, sir,” remarked
Frank. “You’re referring to what Bob
and myself saw, that time we were on our way to
find out what made the queer growling and thunder-like
sounds on that mountain?”</p>

<p>“Just what I mean,” nodded Colonel Haywood.
“You remember you told me that when
you were camped in the dark, near the beginning
of the canyon, you were startled to hear the
thud of many horses’ hoofs; and looking out, saw
a troop pass by, many of the animals being led by
unknown riders.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Frank went on, quickly, “and at the
time, Bob and myself just kept quiet, and they
never suspected we were anywhere near. You
see, we couldn’t make sure at the time whether
they were some cow punchers from a ranch, taking
home some new stock, and making use of the
canyon over Thunder Mountain as a short-cut to
the country beyond; or the rustlers. And as we
hadn’t lost any saddle band just then, we didn’t
care to mix in.”</p>

<p>“As near as I can figure out, Frank, it was that
night, or the one before, when the raid was made
on that Cibiou Creek ranch. And the more I<!-- 034.png -->
think of it, the firmer grows my conviction that
over beyond Thunder Mountain somewhere Mendoza
has his hidden corral, in some lost valley
none of us know anything about!”</p>

<p>“Just as you say, dad, the chances look that
way,” Frank admitted. “And if Circle Ranch
meets with a loss any of these fine mornings, that’s
where we’ll have to look to recover our stock. It
may come sooner than any of us think. And
dad, even if it’s the X—bar—X, or the Arrowhead,
that stands the next loss, don’t you think
we’d all better sink our differences, and unite
against the common enemy?”</p>

<p>“I had made up my mind to that, Frank,”
replied the stockman, firmly. “The time for our
fall round-up is now close at hand, and the way
things look we ought to make a good showing, unless
something unforseen drops down on us.
They say we have the finest herds in the whole
section; and the branding before winter sets in
ought to be the biggest ever.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and that’s just the reason we may be
the next one to suffer at the hands of Mendoza,”
observed Frank. “They say he keeps tabs on all
the ranches, and even has many spies. In that
way he knows about the condition of the herds,
and makes his plans so carefully that he never
was known to carry away anything but the very
best.”</p>

<p>“What you say about spies has occurred to me
more than once,” remarked the rancher. “I’ve
even thought it possible that he might have one
of his friends here. But it’s hard to suspect any
of our boys, they’ve all seemed so faithful. In
the other days, now, there was Spanish Joe, and
his nephew, Abajo, both of whom I felt sure had
communication with Mendoza. I was glad to be
rid of the greasers. Still, there may be some one
at Circle Ranch who sends word on the sly to the
rustlers.”</p>

<p>“It would be a bad thing for him if the boys
ever learned of his treachery,” declared Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, they’d either tar and feather him,” said
Frank grimly, “or else put it out of his power to
send any more messages. But I hope it isn’t so,
dad. Just now, with such fine prospects before
us, and, as you say, the fall round-up at hand,
we’ve got to be more watchful than usual over
our herds, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“And son,” Colonel Haywood said, in a convincing
way, “I’ve made up my mind that to-night’s
the last one we’ll let our cattle stay away
on the range. We’ve got three big bunches out
now, with two boys to act as night wranglers for
each herd, it’s true, but they’re miles away from
here. If anything swooped down on those
steers, we mightn’t know it for hours.”</p>

<p>Gradually the conversation took a different<!-- 036.png -->
turn, and before the two boys went in to sleep
they had for the time being quite forgotten the
fears of the early evening.</p>

<p>By ten o’clock everything seemed quiet and
peaceful around the ranch house. Over where
the punchers bunked one cowboy was playing a
banjo, and there was some little singing; but by
degrees even this died away.</p>

<p>The moon sailed high overhead in a clear sky.
Midnight came and went. A touch of coolness in
the air told of coming fall, though as a rule winter
was not a time to be much feared in this warm
section of the southwest, even if “northers” did
blow in upon them occasionally, that caught the
herds on the range, and brought about some loss
of stock.</p>

<p>Bob had been dreaming of his Kentucky home,
as he often did. Perhaps with some of his boyhood
comrades he may have been visiting the “ole
swimmin’ hole,” and amid much whooping was
engaged in one of the mud battles that marked
those visits. Then again, he may have dreamed
that he was once more climbing the tower of the
church in the dead of night, dispatched by his
prank-loving companions to ring the bell, and
startle the village out of sleep.</p>

<p>He sat up in bed to find Frank shaking him.
Yes, a bell was certainly ringing furiously enough;
but it belonged to no church.<!-- 037.png --></p>

<p>“Get up, and fling some clothes on, Bob,”
Frank was saying.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? House afire?” gasped
Bob, a little dazed still, even as he started to follow
the directions of his energetic chum.</p>

<p>“Don’t know,” replied the hurrying Frank;
“but I hear dad shouting out there. He’s rousing
the boys—you can catch their whoops now!”</p>

<p>“Great guns! I wonder what it all means!”
ejaculated Bob, shivering with excitement.<!-- 038.png --></p>
</div>

<div id='chIV' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER IV<br/>WHEN THE RUSTLERS CAME</h2>

<p>Bob Archer always believed that he made
record time in getting dressed that night. Just
how long it took him he never knew; but Frank
seemed to vie with him in speed, for they rushed
out together.</p>

<p>One glance overhead told Frank that it was not
far from morning. The position of the moon in
the sky gave the prairie boy that information.
Possibly Bob would never had thought of looking
aloft, had he wished to know how the night was
passing. All his life he had depended on watches
and clocks, which might go wrong; whereas
Frank’s celestial timepiece was always trustworthy.</p>

<p>There certainly was much excitement about the
ranch buildings just then.</p>

<p>Cow punchers, half dressed, were pouring out
of the bunk-house, shouting, everyone according
to his taste. Like Bob, most of them believed
that the alarm must mean that a fire had broken
out, and quick work would be needed to get the
flames under control.<!-- 039.png --></p>

<p>Their astonishment at not discovering a red
glare would have been amusing, only that the two
saddle boys realized the occasion must be serious.</p>

<p>Above all the other sounds the voice of Colonel
Haywood could be heard. He was on the piazza
of the ranch house, and calling to the men to come
to him.</p>

<p>Immediately there seemed to be half a score of
cowboys gathering around just below where the
stockman stood. Evidently the Colonel, too, had
been suddenly aroused from sleep, for he was
only partly dressed.</p>

<p>Frank could not remember ever having seen his
father so alarmed. Perhaps by this time Frank
was able to give half a guess as to the cause for
the commotion. In this he was aided by the fact
that his father was not alone. Seated in one of
the easy chairs was a figure. It was that of a
man, and Frank felt sure he could recognize Andy
Lane, one of the cow punchers who had been left
out on the range as a night wrangler, to watch the
herds that were quartered miles away from the
big corral.</p>

<p>Something, then, must evidently have happened
to bring Andy home. He undoubtedly brought
serious news that had inflamed the mind of the
usually cool rancher, and would account for his
excited manner.</p>

<p>Frank looked further. He was accustomed to<!-- 040.png -->
seeing things that might escape many another, less
observing. To his mind Andy was breathing
very hard, and he looked as though he might have
passed through a recent disturbance of some sort.</p>

<p>Immediately the boy remembered the conversation
he had had with his father concerning a possible
descent of the rustlers on one of their choice
herds. Had such a catastrophe really happened?
Would that account for the disturbed appearance
of the cowboy who had been left out on the range
to watch the cattle?</p>

<p>“What is it, Colonel?” demanded one of the
assembled punchers.</p>

<p>“We’re all here, and we want to know!” called
another eagerly.</p>

<p>“That’s Andy, boys, a-settin’ thar; an’ he looks
mighty bad used up!” shouted a third; at which
deep murmurs arose, as a suspicion of the truth
began to break in upon the minds of the wild riders
of the range.</p>

<p>“They’ve come down on us at last, boys,” said
Colonel Haywood, trying to master his emotion,
though Frank could detect an unaccustomed
tremor in his voice, and saw that his face was
white with suppressed passion.</p>

<p>“The rustlers!”</p>

<p>Those two words seemed to start at one end of
the semi-circle, and pass along from mouth to
mouth. There was a bitterness in the way they<!-- 041.png -->
were spoken, which told better than anything else
how deep was the detestation the Circle cowboys
entertained for the stealers of horses and
cattle.</p>

<p>“Mendoza and his crowd have been on the
watch,” continued the stockman; “and saw that
we were in the prize class this fall, with the best
herds. They waited for the right time to strike.
Another night, and our herds would have been
safe in the big corral up to the time of the round-up.
Mendoza knew all about it. He must have
had word from some spy who visits around the
ranches. And he got what he came after, boys!”</p>

<p>A chorus of angry exclamations interrupted the
stockman.</p>

<p>He held up his hand to signal for silence again,
and then went on:</p>

<p>“You know that Andy was left in charge of the
pick of our stock this night, out on the best grass,
with Clem Stiles to help. He rapped on the window
of my room, and woke me up. He was covered
with dust and blood. Before he said a single
word I just knew what had happened. Before
Andy had half told me I was dressed, and ringing
the alarm bell. Andy, speak up and let the boys
know what dropped down on you!”</p>

<p>The dilapidated figure that had been lying back
in the chair managed to struggle to his feet. Although
he had been badly used, Andy was still<!-- 042.png -->
full of grit. It takes a good deal to put a genuine
cowboy down for good.</p>

<p>“They sneaked in on us all right, boys,” he
said; “never would ’a thought it could ’a been
played on me thataways; but they sure caught us
’a nappin’. First thing we knowed we was
pounced on by a bunch of fellers that had ther
handkerchiefs tied ’round the lower part of their
faces. We kicked good and hard, me an’ Clem,
but what was the use? They was four to one
agin us, and it wa’n’t long before we was both
done up.”</p>

<p>“Did ye know any of ’em, Andy?” called out
Ted Conway.</p>

<p>“Nary a one,” replied the other; “’cause you
see it was only moonlight, and them rags over
their faces did the business. Besides, we was
hurted a heap by the time the racket was over.
They tied us like a couple of roped steers, and left
us lie there, not carin’ whether we bleeded to
death or not.”</p>

<p>“Then they ran the stock away, did they,
Andy?” asked one of the listeners.</p>

<p>“We heard ’em get busy, while we wrestled
with the ropes,” continued the other. “They’d
taken our guns along, and our hosses, too. As
we laid thar we could hear the herd get under way.
And the style them rustlers did things, it was clean
easy to see every one of ’em had been a honest<!-- 043.png -->
cow puncher in his time. Reckon that in less’n
half an hour arter we was keeled over, I heard the
last of the hoofs of the herd pass away.”</p>

<p>“How long ago was that, Andy?” asked the
Colonel.</p>

<p>“Must a been ’bout midnight when they kim
down on us, sir,” replied the other.</p>

<p>“And then what did you and Clem do?” pursued
the stockman, who was by degrees becoming
more collected, as he realized that if ever he
needed a cool head the time was now.</p>

<p>“I was workin’ like a house afire to git my
hands loose, Colonel,” Andy continued. “Clem,
I knowed, was hurted worse nor me, for he said
he believed his ankle must a been broke. Once I
couldn’t get him to answer, an’ then I reckoned as
how poor Clem had fainted from the pain.”</p>

<p>“You got loose in the end, Andy?”</p>

<p>“I sure did, after workin, it seemed, for hours.
Clem was able to talk again; but after I managed
to get his rope off, an’ stood him up, we seen it
was no go. He couldn’t walk a step. So I says
as how I’d have to make the run in alone. I
reckon I must a lost some blood myself. Don’t
know what else made me feel so weak every little
while. Must a took me a coon’s age to git here.
Sorry I couldn’t ’a done it better, but——”</p>

<p>Colonel Haywood was just in time to catch the
falling figure of Andy. The poor fellow was indeed<!-- 044.png -->
so weakened from all he had gone through,
besides the loss of blood from his several wounds,
that he had fainted.</p>

<p>No shouts arose from the gathered cowboys.
Their feelings were too deep just then for utterance.
As the late vidette was carried into the
ranch house, the employees of Circle Ranch
clustered there, talking in low but significant tones.</p>

<p>“Get in and finish dressing,” said Bart Heminway,
the energetic foreman. “Then come back
here again to take orders. And be sure you carry
plenty of ammunition. It may be needed before
we’re through with this business. For, take it
from me, boys, the Circle Ranch is a-goin’ to get
back that herd, if Pedro Mendoza has to be
chased away down across the border into Mexico.”</p>

<p>Frank and Bob followed suit. When they came
out again, bearing their repeating rifles, and
dressed for a long ride, they found every fellow
once more on the spot, only waiting for the
Colonel to say the word.</p>

<p>“No need of any hurry, boys,” said the stockman,
who had evidently been making his plans
while completing his own dressing. “They can’t
get that herd away as fast as we can follow. First
it’s our duty to bring in the other two herds, and
make sure of ’em.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Colonel,” called one cowboy;
“nice joke it’d be on us to have ’em drop down<!-- 045.png -->
and get the rest of the stock while we was ridin’
’round lookin’ for signs.”</p>

<p>“Then get away, and see that every animal is
safe in the big corral by morning. Afterward
we’ll settle on our plan. And rest easy, boys, this
time nothing is going to keep us from running
down Mendoza’s rustlers! They believe they’ll be
able to hoodwink us again; but wait and see. Perhaps
they can; but the pitcher may go to the well
once too often. So can Mendoza. Success has
made him bold. We must clips his wings, boys!”</p>

<p>At that sort of talk a cheer burst forth from
the Circle riders. They already knew their part
in the drive, and while about half of them galloped
after the foreman, the others followed Ted
Conway in an opposite direction.<!-- 046.png --></p>

<div id='chV' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER V<br/>AT THE QUICKSANDS</h2>

<p>“Sounds like it’s coming from the east, which
means that herd is safe!” remarked Bob, as he
and his chum stood in the faint light of early
morning, listening eagerly to the sounds of cattle
moving—the clicking of long-horns striking, the
peculiar snap of hoofs, and every now and then
a low bellow from some steer that had been
prodded to keep him in line with the course leading
to the big corral.</p>

<p>“Listen again!” exclaimed Frank, with evident
satisfaction in his voice.</p>

<p>“Did you think you caught sounds, too, from
over in the other direction?” asked Bob, seeing
his chum appeared to have his attention turned
that way.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m sure of it,” came the reply.</p>

<p>“That would mean both herds are safe, then,
Frank?”</p>

<p>“Glad to say it looks that way,” replied the
other, whose keen hearing could often catch<!-- 047.png -->
sounds that were unheard by the less keen ears
of Bob.</p>

<p>Presently there could be no doubt about it.
From two directions came great herds of prime
cattle, steers, cows and calves partly grown, and
many ready to be branded at the fall round-up so
near at hand.</p>

<p>For a time there was more or less excitement,
as the herds were driven through the gateway into
the great corral, where they could find abundant
pasturage for a day or two, while the main body of
cowboys were away. Several men must be left
behind to attend to the cattle, and these could
during the day drive the big herd forth to the
nearest grass and water.</p>

<p>After breakfast ponies were looked after, and
a thousand and one preparations made that had an
ominous significance. Had the rustler, Pedro
Mendoza, only been able to look in on Circle
Ranch just then, it must have flattered his pride
to know what an upheaval his raid had created.
And possibly it may have also rendered him a bit
uneasy, because of the warlike signs which those
determined cowboys manifested as they prepared
to take to the trail.</p>

<p>Colonel Haywood would not hurry, however.</p>

<p>“We’ve got the whole day before us, boys,”
he said, when some of the more impatient urged
that they get away faster, “and others to follow,
if need be. They can’t drive a big herd away
faster than we can follow, if only we keep to the
trail. We must watch out all the while for trickery.
Mendoza has won out that way every time
he ran off a bunch of cattle, deceiving those who
tried to follow. And this time we mean to follow
him to his secret cache, remember that,
boys!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! that’s the talk!” shouted several,
their confidence in the wisdom of their employer
returning.</p>

<p>In due time, then, a determined body of cowboys
galloped away from the ranch buildings,
heading for the range where Andy and Clem had
been watching their herd at the time of the night
raid.</p>

<p>Besides the Colonel, and the two saddle boys,
there were ten well armed men in the group of
riders that clattered away, with the customary vim
of their class, waving their hats to those who
could not take part in the ride, and apparently
filled with the utmost enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Bart Heminway was there for his advice would
prove valuable under certain conditions; because
the foreman was a veteran in the cattle line. Besides,
he had long been known as something of a
fighter, and in case they came to a pitched battle
with the rustlers, his experience would be worth
considerable.<!-- 049.png --></p>

<p>Bob was naturally deeply interested in everything
he saw and heard. While he had now been
in the Southwest more than a year, this was his
first experience in a dangerous foray against
those pests of the stockmen, the cattle rustlers.
And Bob had heard so much about Mendoza
and his night riders that, boylike, he was anxious
to actually see the clever Mexican at close
quarters.</p>

<p>“What do you think your father will do,
Frank, if we manage to find where Mendoza
hangs out?” he asked his chum as they galloped
along, Domino and Buckskin having little trouble
in keeping up with the balance of the horses.</p>

<p>“That depends a good deal on what Mendoza
does himself,” replied Frank. “If he’s wise
enough to vamoose at sight of us, perhaps we
won’t get a crack at any of the bunch. But if he
tries to stand by the herd, and fight for it, I reckon
there’ll be some warm doings, Bob.”</p>

<p>“I hope we can follow the trail; and for the
life of me I can’t see how they could hide the
marks of fifty head of cattle. It must take pretty
fine work, Frank, to do that, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“Oh! they’re up to all that sort of thing,”
Frank replied. “I’ve heard some of our boys
say an Indian would be clumsy at hiding tracks
alongside a few of Mendoza’s best hands. But
wait and see what happens, Bob; perhaps we’ve<!-- 050.png -->
got a few fellows along just as smart at finding a
trail as they are at hiding one.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” Bob rejoined. “I’d just hate
to have to go home like a whipped dog, that
carries his tail between his legs. And Frank,
don’t you remember what your father said about
Thunder Mountain, and how we saw a string of
horses being led into the canyon that night?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” replied Frank, quickly and significantly;
“that’s part of the game. We’re bound
to scratch Thunder Mountain all over with a fine-tooth
comb before we give up beat. If Mendoza
does have a hidden cache in some little valley,
where he keeps his stolen herds, and changes the
brands before driving them to market, we expect
to find it, and get back our property.”</p>

<p>“We must be getting near the place where
Andy wrangled his herd last night,” Bob went on.</p>

<p>“Right ahead there,” replied Frank. “How
are you feeling just now, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Fine and dandy; and just wild to know how
we’re going to come out,” Bob answered.
“Fact is, I wouldn’t have a single care or worry
on my mind right now, if it wasn’t for that
knife!”</p>

<p>“Oh! rats! will you never forget that, Bob?
I was in hopes you’d dream where it was,” laughed
Frank.</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t, and that’s a fact,” the other<!-- 051.png -->
went on, with a quick look at his chum’s face;
“and I don’t suppose you did, either, Frank?”</p>

<p>“I should say not, Bob. I give you my word
I’ve never set eyes on that blade since I saw you
use it the day before yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Oh! where was that, Frank; perhaps you
might give me a little clue, and there’s no telling
what it might lead to,” demanded the Kentucky
boy, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you remember about it?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t just seem to get a line on it,” Bob
answered, gloomily. “Seems to just come to me,
and then it slips away. I used the knife, you say;
was it when we were eating lunch on that little
hunt we took, Frank?”</p>

<p>“No. Have you forgotten that you started in
to show me how much you knew about cutting up
a deer the right way?” Frank asked, still laughing
at his chum.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare, that’s a fact, Frank; of
course I had to use my knife when I carved that
antelope you ‘tolled’ up with your red handkerchief,
and knocked over before he was able to
satisfy his curiosity. But, Frank, I’m nearly <i>dead</i>
sure I can remember having the knife <i>after</i> that—while
we were eating, for instance.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you did, Bob, but honest, that’s the
last time I can remember seeing you use it.
Here we are at the place now. And watch how
our trailers get busy.”</p>

<p>Two of the cow punchers, who were known to
be superior hands at following an obscure trail,
were thrown out ahead. The rest kept just a
little to the rear, since they did not wish to interfere.</p>

<p>Even one who was known as a greenhorn could
have followed the broad trail of fifty head of
cattle, leaving that spot. These men were doing
more. As they rode back and forth, their
keen eyes on the constant watch for signs, they
began to pick up facts that would presently tell
them just how many of the rustlers there had
been in the party.</p>

<p>“Eight all told,” one of the men reported presently;
“an’ the pony with the cloven hoof is one
Spanish Joe used to ride when he was on our
range.”</p>

<p>Bob listened to this with growing wonder. He
could not for the life of him see how the actual
number of the thieves could be discovered so
early in the pursuit.</p>

<p>“I’m sure to learn a heap before we get back
to the ranch again,” he mentioned to his chum.</p>

<p>“I just reckon you will,” Frank replied, with
a grim smile; for he knew better than the boy
from Kentucky what difficulties would have to be
surmounted, and what dangers encountered, ere<!-- 053.png -->
they could wrest that stolen herd from the lawless
men in whose possession it now remained.</p>

<p>An hour’s riding, and the party brought up beyond
the Purple Sage mesa, where, on that former
occasion, the dozen cattle that had vanished in
company with Old Baldy had been traced, to have
the trail end near the dreaded quicksands that had
swallowed occasional stray mavericks for years.</p>

<p>Some of the cowboys looked serious, as though
they feared that a wholesale sacrifice had been
made to the deceptive sands, which never gave up
anything upon which they had fastened their terrible
grip.</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe anything of the sort for a
minute, boys,” declared the stockman, positively,
as they sat in the saddles looking at the deceptive
hole which seemed to invite them on, as offering
a short-cut across the nearby mountain passes.
“Fifty head of fine cattle didn’t drop in there last
night; and driven by expert cow punchers at that.
Get busy now, and find out just where the trail
turned to the right or left, no matter how it was
covered up later. Here’s where we turn over a
page, and expose Senor Mendoza’s fine hand.
On the jump, everybody now!”</p>
</div>

<div id='chVI' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER VI<br/>THE HIDDEN TRAIL OF MENDOZA</h2>

<p>There was an immediate scattering of the ten
cowboys. Every one was eager to be first to
make a discovery. Jumping to the ground, they
searched the earth for traces that would indicate
how the herd had not passed into the quivering
quicksands, but turned aside.</p>

<p>No matter how cleverly the rustlers had concealed
the marks of the many hoofs, and left a
few time-worn tracks to deceive, some of those
keen eyes now on the search were bound to discover
what they so eagerly sought.</p>

<p>A quick call from one quarter soon announced
that the expected signs had been found. Riding
that way Frank and Bob saw that the trailer
Scotty was indicating his discovery to Bart Heminway
and the stockman.</p>

<p>They agreed with him that it pointed to the
fact of the herd having been driven that way. A
little further on, and they saw fresh signs that had
escaped the scrutiny of the rustlers when they
were busy concealing all marks, as they believed,
to indicate the passage of the lost herd.<!-- 055.png --></p>

<p>So it continued until finally they reached rocky
ground, where there would be less to conceal.</p>

<p>“I can’t see how they do it,” declared Bob, as
he watched the two men in the lead running back
and forth like a couple of dogs, their ponies having
been taken in charge by some of their comrades.</p>

<p>“Well,” chuckled Frank, “I happen to know
that one of them, Scotty there, would be just as
surprised to hear you read any book you happened
to pick up; because, you see, Scotty doesn’t
know how to read. The ground is like a printed
page to him. He sees scores of little signs you
would never notice. And they tell him things,
just as the letters, placed in combinations, tell you
a certain word is meant.”</p>

<p>“But Frank, look over yonder,” said Bob,
pointing ahead.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see it, all right,” replied the other,
with a nod and a laugh.</p>

<p>“Our old friend, Thunder Mountain, isn’t it?”
demanded Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” replied the other. “The
same place where we had our little bunch of adventures
with a grizzly, a cloudburst, and a few
other things; not to forget a certain fellow named
Peg Grant, who tried to play the game ahead of
us, but fell down.”</p>

<p>“And, Frank, you notice, I reckon, that we<!-- 056.png -->
seem to be heading right in the direction of that
big <i>arroyo</i> that leads up the side of the mountain?”
Bob went on.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t surprise me one little bit, Bob,”
his chum remarked. “You remember we figured
all that out. Fact is, things begin to look mighty
good to me; and I reckon we’re closer to finding
that secret corral of Pedro Mendoza right at this
very minute than anybody has ever been before.”</p>

<p>“It’s noon now; and there’s your father holding
up his hand,” Bob remarked.</p>

<p>“Which means he wants a halt called, while we
take a cold snack, and talk matters over,” Frank
observed. “You know, my dad is noted for being
cool, and going slow about things. I’ve seen
lots of others lose their heads; but he was nearer
to being excited last night than I ever saw him.
Chances are, we may lie low here half the afternoon,
because he’d rather climb that canyon after
nightfall.”</p>

<p>Frank’s prophecy proved a true one, for as they
ate and talked, the stockman proceeded to explain
his plan, which was really to remain quiet where
they were, under the shade of a clump of willows,
until the afternoon was well spent. Then the
ride could be resumed, though no one doubted
now where it would lead them, with that canyon
mouth so near at hand.<!-- 057.png --></p>

<p>Several hours passed. They were almost endless
to impatient Bob, who suffered very much because
of his nervousness, and a desire to be moving.
But finally Colonel Haywood seemed to be
satisfied that the object of the delay had been accomplished,
whatever that might be; and he gave
the word for which the cow punchers had been
so eagerly waiting.</p>

<p>Again they were on the move. Just as Frank
had said, the trail led them into the great <i>arroyo</i>,
that looked like a cleft in the mountain from a
little distance.</p>

<p>Sometimes this pass was used by stockmen on
one side of the range as a means of getting a
herd over to the other side. Hence it was not
strange to find plain traces of cattle having been
driven along here. And the rustlers depended on
this very knowledge to allow of a slackening of
their labors in trying to wipe out all tell-tale
marks.</p>

<p>Once in the gap, and the sun was no longer to
be seen. Indeed, it looked dim between those
high walls, and one could almost believe evening
must be near at hand.</p>

<p>“And to think, Frank,” said Bob, “that when
we were here before we thought these cliffs were
the real thing. We know better now, don’t we?
We’ve been in the Grand Canyon of the Colorado.
And, Frank, you could put that wall yonder<!-- 058.png -->
against one of the colored ones up there, and it
would look like an ant hill. Am I right?”</p>

<p>“I reckon you are, Bob,” replied the other.
“But that hasn’t anything to do with our finding
the lost cattle. Let’s think of that now. Watch
Scotty up ahead there. He’s going some, I tell
you. A hound couldn’t follow tracks much
better.”</p>

<p>“He’s a wonder, that’s what,” declared Bob.</p>

<p>“And I suppose you’re picking up heaps of information
right along, eh?” Frank asked, with
an amused smile.</p>

<p>“To be sure I am; but there seems to be no
end to the game,” replied Bob. “I’m just loaded
up to my neck with questions I want to ask Scotty
when I get a chance. He must tell me why he did
this thing and that.”</p>

<p>“And this is only the beginning, you’ll find,”
observed Frank. “There are a lot more coming
along soon that you don’t want to miss, Bob.”</p>

<p>They kept along for another half hour, continually
ascending the rocky pass. To Bob there
was an added interest in their surroundings because
of the adventures that had come to Frank
and himself during their earlier visit to Thunder
Mountain, as recorded in the first volume of this
series.</p>

<p>“Look, Frank!” he exclaimed, calling the attention
of his companion to a certain place, high<!-- 059.png -->
up on one of the walls, “wasn’t that where we
had to climb to get away from the flood that
rushed through this pass when the cloudburst
came?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the other, “I can see the very
ledge we stood on, wondering if we would be
carried away, or not. That was a narrow squeak,
Bob, for us.”</p>

<p>“I believe you, Frank; but we pulled through,
all right. More than once since then, when things
have looked ticklish, I think of that time, and
make up my mind the sky isn’t so dark as it looks.
But it sure is getting near night down in this
hole!”</p>

<p>“Are you watching Scotty, Bob?” demanded
Frank.</p>

<p>“I saw him turn aside just then,” replied the
other. “Looked like he was interested a little
in that narrow crack in the wall; but I see he’s
passed on, and is waving to the bunch to come
after him; so I reckon there wasn’t anything doing
there.”</p>

<p>“Huh! don’t be too sure of that,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“Why, what do you mean?” demanded his
chum, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Because I saw Scotty give my dad a quick sign
that stood for something,” Frank went on to say.</p>

<p>“About that little hole in the wall, you mean?”
asked Bob.<!-- 060.png --></p>

<p>“It was while he was down on his hands
and knees there that he made it, so I’ve got a
hunch it was about that same hole. But don’t
seem to pay any particular attention as we ride
past.”</p>

<p>“Then you think there might be somebody
watching us; is that it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Why not, if these rustlers are half as smart
as they say, don’t you think they would be apt to
have a vidette posted on the side of the mountain?”
and Frank declined to turn his head in the
slightest as they rode past the cleft, that hardly
seemed wide enough for a fat steer to pass into.</p>

<p>They rode slowly along up the canyon, picking
their way carefully around such obstructions as
came in the path.</p>

<p>“Have you been looking to see if there are
as many signs up here as below?” Bob asked
of his chum, as he noticed Frank watching the
ground by bending over in his saddle.</p>

<p>“I don’t seem to get on to them, if they are,”
replied the other. “But then, we’d better hold in
our horses a little, and hear what Scotty has to
say. Pretty soon he’ll call a halt, and then we’ll
know.”</p>

<p>But they continued on until it became so
dark in the canyon that the ponies frequently
stumbled. Scotty had fallen back, and was riding
alongside the stockman now, with whom he<!-- 061.png -->
seemed to be conversing eagerly, as though he
had news worth while to communicate.</p>

<p>Then Colonel Haywood threw up his hand. It
was a signal to halt, recognized by every one in
the party. Pressing in a little circle around the
leaders, they waited to hear how things were
working.</p>

<p>“We leave the ponies up here, boys,” said the
stockman, “and go back on foot. Do you remember
noticing that little split in the left side of
the <i>arroyo</i>, where Scotty halted a few seconds?
Well, the herd was driven through that, one at a
time. It’s the secret passage no one has ever
been able to find, up to now.”</p>

<p>All sorts of low exclamations told how eagerly
the cow punchers received the welcome news that
the long hidden trail had been found.</p>

<p>“How do you suppose Scotty ever made that
out?” asked Bob, unable to hold his curiosity
in check. “Frank, do you reckon he found the
tracks of the cattle on the stones, where the rustlers
failed to make ’em out?”</p>

<p>“Well, there might be lots of ways of knowing
that,” replied the other boy. “And to tell you
the truth, Bob, I saw Scotty taking a quick look at
the sharp edges of the rock just where the crack
starts. Now, it wouldn’t surprise, me much if he
discovered some bunches of hair fastened there,
where it was rubbed off the flank of a steer that<!-- 062.png -->
didn’t quite take the middle of the road while
passing in.”</p>

<p>“I never thought of that,” Bob said, in a low
tone. “That’s another page made clear. Oh!
but all this is mighty interesting to me, I tell you,
Frank. I only wish I could write shorthand, and
I’d have it all down in black and white.”</p>

<p>“Huh! better have it written in your memory,
where it can never be rubbed out,” remarked
Frank, dismounting, as all the others were doing.<!-- 063.png --></p>
</div>

<div id='chVII' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER VII<br/>THE SECRET VALLEY</h2>

<p>“What’s the programme, Frank?” asked the
Kentucky boy, a short time later, after they had
taken the horses into a little bay, which the
Colonel called a <i>cul-de-sac</i>, where they could be
easily kept by piling up some of the big rocks at
the mouth; though one cowboy must be left to
guard them.</p>

<p>“As I understand it,” replied Frank, “it’s first
a bite to eat, and then down the canyon for ours.
When we come to that hole in the wall, we’ll slip
through, and find out where we bring up.”</p>

<p>“But Frank, do you really believe all that herd
passed through that little opening? Why, they’d
fill any sort of cave; and besides, how under the
sun would they get anything to eat?”</p>

<p>“Well, remember that I’m only guessing,” returned
his chum; “but here’s the way I figure it
out. That cleft in the wall runs back some little
way, and perhaps keeps getting bigger all the
while. Presently it turns into a regular trail<!-- 064.png -->
over the rocks, that the cattle will follow single
file. And mark me, Bob, sooner or later they’ll
turn up in a valley among the mountains here, that
no cowboy has ever set eyes on—that is, unless
he’s in with Mendoza.”</p>

<p>“Sounds like a fairy story, Frank,” objected
Bob, who was very practical.</p>

<p>“Lots of things do, until you really pass
through the experience, and then you know they
are the real article. I feel that my dad believes
the same way I do; and Bart Heminway, too.
But we’ll know after a while, Bob, if we just hold
our horses. There, get busy with some of that
grub you’re carrying. We don’t have to depend
on getting game this time, in order to make sure
of a supper.”</p>

<p>The moon was up when they prepared to quit
the spot. One rider was left behind to guard the
saddle band.</p>

<p>Down the canyon then, they went like a bunch of
shadows, flitting silently along. All talking above
whispers was positively forbidden. Reaching the
spot where that mysterious opening occurred in
the wall of the canyon, Scotty slipped inside without
a moment’s delay, the others following after,
one at a time.</p>

<p>Bob kept close behind his chum. He had several
good reasons for that. In the first place
Frank was sure-footed, and would serve as a<!-- 065.png -->
guide to his less experienced comrade. Then
again, if there arose any occasion for communications,
Bob wanted to be where he could whisper
in his chum’s ear.</p>

<p>Just as Frank had said he believed would prove
to be the case, that cleft in the rocks did turn
out to be a narrow passage. It wound in and out
for some distance. Once Bob saw the man in the
lead strike a match, and look at the rocks at his
feet. Scotty appeared quite satisfied with the result
of his examination; and Bob saw him showing
something that he had picked up, to the stockman.</p>

<p>Then the match went out; and the march was
resumed.</p>

<p>“Look up, Bob!” whispered Frank, presently.</p>

<p>“Why, I can see the stars!” answered the
other, also keeping his voice down.</p>

<p>“Sure you can; which shows that we’ve come
out from the passage and once more stand in the
open. We’ve passed through one of the walls of
the mountains. This is some narrow valley back
of the outer part. And it’s sure going to lead us
to the hidden corral where Mendoza keeps all his
stolen stock!”</p>

<p>As they kept on Bob was fortified to undergo
any amount of fatigue. The thought of being connected
with the expedition that might unearth the
long cherished secret of the rustlers was enough<!-- 066.png -->
to give anyone additional courage and endurance.</p>

<p>Still, when an hour had passed, and they were
still on the move, he admitted that he was getting
a little tired.</p>

<p>Now and then they could get glimpses of the
moon, though as a rule their passage was continued
through dense shadows, where the overhanging
rocks shut out the light; or the same result
was obtained through the trees under which
the trail led.</p>

<p>Looking up from time to time Bob could see the
outline of a ridge on either side. He could not
remember ever having looked upon such a
peculiar formation during his previous visit to
Thunder Mountain. Then Frank’s surmise must
have hit near the truth, and they were now moving
along a narrow little valley that was artfully
concealed behind the crest of the mountain.</p>

<p>“How about it, getting tired?” questioned
Frank, when an opportunity arose that brought
their heads close together.</p>

<p>“Oh! nothing to speak of,” replied the other;
for Bob was proud, and would never willingly
admit that he lacked in nerve or ability to equal
others in anything undertaken.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a hunch that we must be near the
turning-off place,” Frank went on, with the idea of
bolstering up the waning powers of his chum.</p>

<p>“That sounds as if you didn’t believe this might<!-- 067.png -->
be the valley where they keep their stock,” remarked
Bob, wondering a little.</p>

<p>“No more do I believe that it is,” Frank replied.
“It’s lonely enough, all right, but there’s
little save bare rock here; and cattle have to
graze, you understand, Bob. Hold out a little
longer, and I reckon we’re going to run up against
another quick turn. Perhaps it’ll be in the shape
of a second passage under this ridge here on the
left, that will show us into this Mendoza’s retreat.”</p>

<p>The words, somehow, thrilled Bob. He
realized that this was indeed a serious business
upon which, in company with the Circle Ranch
cow punchers, he was now fully embarked. What
the end would be it was impossible to more than
conjecture.</p>

<p>Scotty was constantly on the watch, as though
he, too, anticipated a change in the conditions,
sooner or later, and did not mean to pass the turn
by. Whenever the moon served, he would try to
examine the ground most carefully, evidently
looking for signs that would tell of cattle having
passed this way many times.</p>

<p>Once, when they had not been able to take advantage
of the moon’s light for almost ten minutes,
Scotty grew restless.</p>

<p>“He’s going to strike another match,” remarked
Frank in his chum’s ear, as he saw the<!-- 068.png -->
trailer getting down on hands and knees close to
the rocks.</p>

<p>His prediction proved to be true, for immediately
afterward Bob saw a small glow, with
the face of Scotty pressed close to the ground, as
he moved back and forth, eagerly looking for
something that seemed to be missing.</p>

<p>“He don’t seem able to find it, Frank,” said
Bob, guessing the truth from these signs.</p>

<p>“That’s what,” echoed his chum, who had arrived
at that conclusion half a minute before it
struck Bob.</p>

<p>“What would that mean, then?” continued the
Kentucky boy.</p>

<p>“Only that we must have passed by the place
where the trail turned aside,” Frank answered,
quickly.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have to go back again, and find it;
is that so, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Just what we’ll do,” answered the other, adding:
“There, Scotty is talking it over with dad
and Bart. He’s telling them no stock have ever
come up as high in the valley as this, and that we
must go back to find where they broke out. But
we’re bound to find it, you know, Bob.”</p>

<p>They did, and without any great trouble.
Scotty, knowing that the secret passage must be
just a little below, was on the watch every foot
of the way. And in the end he discovered another<!-- 069.png -->
crevice in the side of the mountain, through which
undoubtedly the stock had been driven.</p>

<p>“Say, but there must have been considerable
excitement around here, when all those steers,
cows and half-grown calves were hustled along
this trail,” Frank whispered, as in imagination he
could see Mendoza’s Mexican rustlers heading
the drove off, and compelling the frightened animals
to enter the second opening.</p>

<p>“I take off my hat to such drivers of cattle as
those fellows,” remarked Bob, who did not understand
how the thing could have been done.</p>

<p>This time they were only a short while in the
narrow cut. All they had to do was to follow
straight ahead, and keep in single file. Every
man was also warned not to try to make haste,
for they did not wish to betray their presence by
any unlucky stumble.</p>

<p>Scotty, in the van, was on the lookout for signs
of a trap. He knew that Mendoza had long ago
earned the name of the “Mexican rat” because
of his cunning; not only in hoodwinking those who
tried to camp on his trail, but on account of his
skill in laying snares for the feet of pursuers.
More than one party had come to grief in times
past just when they expected they had the rustler
chief in a hole.</p>

<p>Bob became suddenly aware of the fact that the
creeping line had stopped. On his arm he felt the<!-- 070.png -->
hand of Frank Haywood; and this pressure was
the signal understood among them.</p>

<p>“Look up ahead!” was whispered in Bob’s
ear; and as he turned his eyes obediently upward,
he discovered what he took to be a giant firefly
glowing in the darkness of the mountainside—it
would vanish, only to again appear, like a small
star!</p>
</div>

<div id='chVIII' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br/>“THE WAY IS CLEAR!”</h2>

<p>“What is it, Frank?” whispered Bob, as he
stared in wonder at the strange firefly that seemed
to appear, and then vanish so regularly.</p>

<p>“A sentry smoking a cigarette,” came the reply.</p>

<p>“How silly of me not to have guessed that,”
thought the Kentucky boy.</p>

<p>And then he sniffed the air, for it chanced that
the night wind was blowing gently from the point
where that fire glowed.</p>

<p>“Smoke, sure enough, and from a cigarette,
just as Frank said,” he continued to himself.</p>

<p>Of course it was very plain now why the expedition
had come to such a sudden halt. Here
was a vidette posted in a position where he could
discover any suspicious movement below. There
was a wide strip of moonlight confronting them,
and it would be difficult to pass along the trail
without crossing this, when of course the keen
eyes above would discover their presence.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do about it, Frank?”
he managed to say in his chum’s ear.<!-- 072.png --></p>

<p>“Nothing—that is, the main lot of us,” replied
Frank.</p>

<p>“But how about Scotty?” Bob continued, determined
to be posted.</p>

<p>“Leave that to him; he’s figuring on doing
something right now,” Frank replied; and indeed,
the Kentucky boy could see that the guide of the
expedition was leaving the main body, as though
he had arranged his programme.</p>

<p>Bob could give a pretty shrewd guess as to what
was necessary. That sentry must not be allowed
to block the way much longer. So long as he sat
there in the shadows above, the cowboys could
not advance a step without taking risks. And if
discovered this early in the night, they knew
that their plans would receive a serious setback.</p>

<p>Evidently Scotty was about to make some sort
of move looking to the capture of the vidette.
Bob had heard Colonel Haywood warn his men
that there was to be no blood shed unless the
rustlers put up a desperate resistance. The stockman
was known as a humane man, and believed in
peaceful tactics whenever possible, although, if
forced to the wall, he could fight hard.</p>

<p>A second cow puncher started to creep immediately
after Scotty. That looked as if they
wanted to make sure of the game.</p>

<p>“Lay low!” was the whispered word passed<!-- 073.png -->
along the line; and hence the two saddle boys remained
where they chanced to be crouching.</p>

<p>Beyond the narrow pass no doubt lay a
fertile valley, which the cunning Mendoza had
long utilized as a corral. Here he kept his stolen
herds, while the brands were being changed.
When the hue and cry had died down no doubt
he would drive the cattle forth, taking care to
avoid the neighborhood where his latest operations
had been carried on.</p>

<p>“Listen hard, and perhaps you’ll hear something
familiar,” Bob heard his comrade whisper.</p>

<p>From this he fancied that what Frank meant
would not have any connection with the presence
of that rustler, perched high on the hillside. So
he concentrated his mind on discovering something
else. A minute later and he drew Frank’s head
close to his own lips, to say:</p>

<p>“Sure thing; I can catch the sound of cattle
moving about; and there was a lowing sound as
plain as I ever heard a cow make. They’re not
half a mile away, Frank; is that so?”</p>

<p>“Just what they are; our lost herd; and perhaps
other stray steers along with ’em,” came
the answer.</p>

<p>Bob was strangely thrilled by the situation. He
seemed to feel that they were on the verge of
great doings. Just beyond lay the enchanted
valley, of which cowboys had often hinted, but<!-- 074.png -->
of which no one seemed to know the exact location.
And soon, when Scotty and his comrade
had cleared the way, they were going to enter that
secret cache of the Mexican rustler, to claim their
own again.</p>

<p>For years had this bold Mendoza been having
things pretty much his own way in the cow country.
He had many secret allies on the ranches,
who sent him word of rich prizes to be captured;
as well as plans on foot looking to his taking.
And by pulling these strings whenever he felt
like it, he had been enabled to laugh at all efforts
undertaken by the stockmen to down him.</p>

<p>Yes, even Bob, the late tenderfoot, could now
understand that there must be a good sized herd
of cattle somewhere nearby. Various sounds declared it.
Besides, when the night breeze happened
to increase in strength for a few seconds
at a time, he believed he could hear the tinkling
of a mandolin, and a man’s voice singing some
Spanish serenade.</p>

<p>Evidently, then, the rustlers were so accustomed
to feeling perfectly secure in this lonely
valley, far away from everything civilized, that
they took life easily, and acted as though quite
at home.</p>

<p>But Scotty and his mate had been gone some
time now, Bob remembered.</p>

<p>“They ought to be getting pretty close up,
hadn’t they, Frank?” he questioned, in the low
tone that had characterized their brief conversation
hitherto.</p>

<p>“Watch the fire!” was all the answer he received;
but it was enough.</p>

<p>Bob knew his chum was anticipating seeing a
change take place at any minute now; that he
fully believed the two agile cow punchers must
have had ample time to crawl up the incline.</p>

<p>He found himself wondering whether the
sentry would make any outcry. Of course any
such sound would threaten the success of their
plans, since it must excite the curiosity of the
rustlers, and lead to an examination.</p>

<p>But then Scotty knew what he was about, and
would hold his hand until he could be sure of
silence and success. Somehow Bob found himself
putting the utmost faith in the cowboy. The
remarkable manner in which Scotty had led them
thus far seemed to stamp him as capable.</p>

<p>The glow of the end of the cigarette could
still be seen in the shadows under that clump of
trees that clung to the face of the mountain. Of
course the man who smoked had consumed more
than one little paper-bound weed during this time,
but Mexicans have a way of rolling them deftly
between their fingers when smoking, and lighting
one from the end of another, in succession.</p>

<p>Straining his eyes, Bob endeavored to make out
some moving form near that point upon which the<!-- 076.png -->
attention of the watchers below was concentrated.
In this he did not succeed. Those who were
creeping upon the man who lolled there, enjoying
his smoke, and perhaps dreaming of some day
when he could return to his native country with
his pockets filled with gold, were moving with
all the care that marks the advance of the gray
panther, when approaching his intended prey.</p>

<p>Bob was becoming uneasy. The strain began
to tell upon him, wholly unaccustomed as he was
to such scenes of excitement and suspense. He
even found himself imagining all sorts of unpleasant
accidents as happening to Scotty, anyone
of which would interfere with the successful carrying
out of his plans.</p>

<p>But Frank seemed to have no such fears.
When Bob started to mention what was worrying
him, his chum immediately eased his mind.</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it for a minute, Bob,” he
whispered. “Scotty is right close to that rustler
now, and perhaps before you could wink fifty
times he’ll make his move. Keep on watching the
light. When it suddenly goes out, and doesn’t
die down, you’ll know something has happened!”</p>

<p>So Bob took fresh heart, and continued to keep
his eyes glued on the point of fire, which he knew
marked the spot where the vidette sat.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly he missed the spark! It had
vanished without the slightest warning. Bob felt
his chum move, and thought Frank gave a little<!-- 077.png -->
gasp as of satisfaction. Yes, and unless his own
ears had deceived him, he caught some sort of
rustling sound up yonder where the vidette had
his post.</p>

<p>Evidently Scotty had acted. From the fact that
there was no outcry, Bob judged that the movement
had been a success.</p>

<p>Still no one among the crouching cowboys
moved hand or foot. They were waiting for a
signal of some sort inviting them onward and upward.
When Scotty and his companion felt sure
that they had the sentry so bound and gagged
that he could not give any alarm, they would
doubtless let their allies know.</p>

<p>The light did not reappear, though Bob
strained his eyes in the effort to discover it. From
this fact he knew that something had indeed
happened.</p>

<p>“Has he got him, do you think, Frank?” he
could not keep from asking, cautiously.</p>

<p>“Not any doubt about it,” came the confident
reply. “I heard him drop; and he would have
whooped it up only Scotty’s fingers closed on his
throat, and cut the yell off. Just give ’em a
minute more to fix him up right, then we’ll get
the sign.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad that part of the job is over,
and no alarm given,” thought Bob, his nerves
relaxing somewhat after the recent strain.<!-- 078.png --></p>

<p>And while he lay there waiting, ready to make
a fresh start when the time came, he heard what
he thought was a little bird uttering a lazy twitter
somewhere up on the mountainside.</p>

<p>Frank began to get up.</p>

<p>“Are you going, Frank?” asked the Kentucky
lad, also rising to his knees.</p>

<p>“Everybody’s on the move,” came the reply.
“Didn’t you hear the signal, Bob?”</p>

<p>“I heard what I thought was the sound of a
sleepy bird disturbed on his perch; was that what
you meant?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Frank. “That came from our
friend Scotty. It told us the way is clear, and
that we might as well get a move on. So here
we start into the valley, where our prize herd is
kept on the grass.”</p>

<p>“They did that thing up handsome, Frank,”
admitted Bob.</p>

<p>“It’s a way Scotty has,” chuckled the other.
“He never goes into anything but he carries it
out like machine work. And Bob, this is only the
beginning, remember. We’ve got a heap cut out
for us yet. It’s going to be a night you’ll never
forget as long as you live. And as for Senor
Mendoza, the boys of Circle Ranch expect to give
him his Waterloo right here in his own camp.
Come along, Bob; show how you can move along
this path into the narrow pass.”</p>
</div>

<div id='chIX' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER IX<br/>THE CATTLE CACHE</h2>

<p>Just as Bob had anticipated, it was found that
the narrow pass served somewhat as the neck
of the bottle. Perhaps it was the only way
whereby cattle could enter or leave the secret valley
lying between the several spurs of the high
ridge. By blocking this pass with rocks, as had
apparently been done, there was little chance of
any wandering on the part of the trapped herd.</p>

<p>The two boys had to clamber over these rocks.
Bob could see that they had recently been moved
to the position they now occupied.</p>

<p>“I wonder how the old chap ever made it?”
he murmured, as he went down the other side of
the barrier.</p>

<p>Frank chuckled, for it happened that just then
his thoughts were roving in exactly the same
quarter that the words spoken by his chum would
indicate held Bob’s attention.</p>

<p>“Now, you’re thinking of Old Baldy, eh
Bob?” he asked, softly.</p>

<p>“Just what I was,” replied the other.<!-- 080.png --></p>

<p>“And wondering how he ever got over all
those rocks when he escaped?” Frank went on.</p>

<p>“He must have had wings to do it, that’s
what, Frank.”</p>

<p>“Oh! shucks!” Frank remarked. “I don’t
believe for a second the old rascal ever went up
over this barricade. Perhaps it didn’t happen to
be here at the time he flew the coop. Then,
again, it might be the sharp old chap found some
other way of leaving the hidden valley, that even
the rustlers know nothing about.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t wonder, Frank,” said the other;
“for he’s as wise as they make ’em, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“No more at present, Bob,” cautioned Frank.</p>

<p>Having climbed over the barrier designed to
block the neck of the valley which had so long
served Mendoza as a hiding place for his stolen
stock, the two lads followed Colonel Haywood
and the cow punchers.</p>

<p>The broad stretch of moonlight had been left
behind, and now they were passing along through
shadows again. Bob hardly knew when Scotty
and his mate joined the column, so silently did
they appear. The first thing he realized, some
one was at the side of the stockman, and appeared
to be conferring with him in low tones as they
moved along; and when they chanced to pass
through a patch of moonlight, he saw that it was
Scotty.<!-- 081.png --></p>

<p>Of course from this he understood that the
sentry had been placed in a condition where he
could do no harm. Somewhere aloft there he
was undoubtedly lying, tied up like a mummy of
the ancient pyramids, and doubtless filled with
wonder as to what had happened.</p>

<p>They seemed to be following what was evidently
a path, partly made by the hoofs of many cattle
coming and going. Now it seemed to run along
over the plain side of the mountain; but occasionally
it hugged the edge of what appeared to be a
sheer descent.</p>

<p>No doubt in the light of day this would have
not been a dangerous route. It was quite a different
thing now, for the moon failed to be of
any assistance, owing to the lay of the land.</p>

<p>Bob was making his way along with more or
less confidence, never dreaming of sudden peril,
for he had faith in his abilities as a mountain
climber. But it proved that, after all, he was
not quite so sure-footed as those who had been
brought up to such work.</p>

<p>Bob always claimed that it was a pebble under
his foot that caused him to slip. He felt a thrill
of alarm as he felt himself going, for a black
gulf lay on that side of him, and he could only
guess how far he would tumble if he went over.</p>

<p>He naturally made a convulsive effort to clutch
some object that would prevent his slipping beyond<!-- 082.png -->
the edge upon which he was now perilously
balanced. And, queer as it might seem, when he
looked back after it was all over, Bob realized
that he was really more concerned about the noise
his fall would make, thus betraying the presence
of his comrades, than what would happen to him
personally.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Frank had been on the watch.
He knew the Kentucky boy was not quite so sure
on his feet as the rest of them; and besides, Bob
must be more or less tired just then.</p>

<p>So when he heard that suspicious grating sound,
which told of a stumble, Frank turned instantly.
His hand shot out and by the best of luck came
in contact with the extended rifle of Bob. There
was a quick clutch, and as Frank had braced himself
for the little shock, he managed to hold the
other. And in another second Bob was once more
back on the path, trembling not a little, but
safe.</p>

<p>“Whew! that was a bad job for me, Frank!”
he gasped.</p>

<p>“It might have been worse,” came from his
chum, rather dryly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean that, and you know it,” added
Bob; “but the noise of that piece of rock I
kicked over the edge, what if it was heard by
some of the rustlers?”</p>

<p>“Not much danger, because you see they’re<!-- 083.png -->
too far away from here. Besides,” Frank continued,
“such a thing wouldn’t alarm them. A
rock may roll down the side of a mountain like
this at any time. It was only the growling that
came from the heart of Thunder Mountain that
used to rattle the Indians and cowboys.”</p>

<p>“But Frank, these rustlers didn’t used to mind
it, did they?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking that over,” his chum replied,
“and I’ve come to the conclusion that
Mendoza must have found out the truth for himself
long ago, and knew about the big geyser
that boiled up inside the mountain.”</p>

<p>“Then he and his men kept it a secret, all
right,” Bob remarked, as he followed close on the
heels of Frank, the dangerous point having now
been passed by.</p>

<p>“It paid him to do that, don’t you see?” Frank
went on. “So long as Indians and ignorant prospectors,
as well as cowboys, believed the place to
be haunted, he knew they would fight shy of
Thunder Mountain, and his valley ranch here
wouldn’t be known. But the worm has turned at
last; and this is going to mark the end of the
rustler’s secret cache.”</p>

<p>Once more Bob held his peace. He was interested
in watching ahead, and noting what
seemed to be lights in the valley.</p>

<p>“Unless I miss my guess, they’re fires, too,” he<!-- 084.png -->
said to himself. “And when that one flamed up
just then I sure saw what looked like a cabin
just back of it. Why, I wouldn’t be surprised if
that Mendoza has got a regular little colony
planted right here! This must be where he lives
when he isn’t out rustling cattle, and running off
with the saddle bands belonging to ranches. Talk
about nerve, would you!”</p>

<p>Of course, as they advanced along the side of
the valley, the sounds that had come so faintly
to their ears when beyond the barrier now grew
more positive. Cattle could be heard, trust the
experienced ears of cowboys for detecting their
presence. Then, besides, voices sounded, as
men called out to one another; while the fellow
who twanged the mandolin persisted in his efforts
to practice on the airs he possibly meant to sing
the next time he went courting down below the
Mexican border.</p>

<p>That the rustlers had been in this place a long
time, unsuspected by any of the stockmen, or even
the State authorities, Frank soon had positive
evidence.</p>

<p>“Say, what’s this mean?” asked Bob, as they
came to what seemed to be a barbed wire fence,
six strands high.</p>

<p>“It’s a corral to keep the cattle in, at times,
perhaps while the branding is going on,” answered
his chum, familiar with all such devices.<!-- 085.png --></p>

<p>“I wager then that Old Baldy broke through
it,” Bob declared.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t think that impossible, because he’s
done it many a time in the past,” Frank whispered
in his turn. “But how did you guess it?”</p>

<p>“Because I noticed, Frank, that he was considerably
torn along one of his shoulders, and
the marks looked fresh, just as barbed fencing
always jabs a steer,” went on the other.</p>

<p>“Good for you, Bob; glad you had your eyes
about you that time,” Frank said; for it always
pleased him to find that his chum was observing
little things, such as serve as straws to show
which way the wind blows.</p>

<p>“I wonder how many men there are in this
place?” Bob continued, for he was so filled with
a desire to obtain information that he could not
keep from asking questions.</p>

<p>“No telling,” Frank replied; “but enough to
give us a tussle in case we have to get down to
hard blows, which I hope we won’t. All we want
is to get back our stock.”</p>

<p>“But if the rustlers try to keep us from recovering
the herd, what then, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Trouble, and of the worst kind,” was the reply.
“But between dad and Scotty and Bart I
reckon they’ll be able to manage things. We’ve
got one chap with his wings clipped right now;
perhaps there may be others, sooner or later.”</p>

<p>“You mean, take them prisoner?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“That would be what my dad would want if he
had his way. But all we have to do is to lie low
and obey orders. I’m ready to help as far as I
can; and I know you are too, Bob.”</p>

<p>“We seem to be creeping closer all the time,”
remarked Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, and for that reason, suppose we stop
talking now. If it’s really necessary you can
whisper close to my ear; but better keep quiet
all you can,” said Frank; and his chum took the
hint.</p>

<p>They could now easily make out the men as
they walked back and forth, or lounged in the
camp. The several cabins and tents could also be
plainly seen, as the fires burned cheerfully, or the
moon looked down on the scene, mounting higher
above the rim of the ridge to the east, fringed
with a straggling row of stunted trees.</p>

<p>Bob had never expected to be given a chance
to look in on the camp of a rustler band, and
especially one so notorious as Pedro Mendoza’s.
More than once he rubbed his eyes as though
suspecting that he might be dreaming; but the
voices of the men around the fires, the clashing
of long-horned cattle near by, and the picture
of the cabins still remained to prove the truth,
and show him that it was real.<!-- 087.png --></p>
</div>

<div id='chX' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER X<br/>A SURPRISE</h2>

<p>When half an hour had passed, both boys began
to grow a little anxious. They knew that,
undoubtedly, those in charge of the expedition
must have been holding a council of war, and
deciding on the course to be carried out.</p>

<p>“Wait here for me, Bob,” Frank whispered.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked the other, suspiciously;
for he wanted to be in any move, as
well as did his chum.</p>

<p>“Just to see dad, and find out what’s doing.
I’ll sure be back again right away,” Frank told
him.</p>

<p>“All right. You’ll find me here, lying like a
log,” grunted Bob. “Fact is, if this keeps on,
I’ll just turn into one, I’m getting that stiff in
the legs.”</p>

<p>Frank crept away softly, and the Kentucky
boy continued to stretch out in the dense shadows,
listening to the sounds that came from the camp
not very far away. A soft murmuring sound<!-- 088.png -->
told Bob that he was near some spring, possibly
that which supplied the drinking water for the
camp; and in running down the side of the valley
it evidently also satisfied the thirst of the cattle
in the corral near by.</p>

<p>In not more than ten minutes, though perhaps
it seemed much longer than that to Bob, his chum
crawled alongside again.</p>

<p>“How?” queried Bob, Indian fashion.</p>

<p>“Oh! they’ve got it all arranged,” Frank answered,
between gasps; for he was breathing
hard, after his recent exertions.</p>

<p>“You mean about capturing the herd, Frank?”</p>

<p>“I mean about making prisoners of the
rustlers,” replied the other; “because, you understand,
we couldn’t run the cattle out of this
place without first clipping the claws of Mendoza
and his crowd.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s so,” replied Bob; “because
such a big bunch of long-horns must make considerable
racket when on the jump.”</p>

<p>“Sure; but then that isn’t the only thing,”
Frank remarked.</p>

<p>“What else would hinder us running ’em off?”
his chum demanded.</p>

<p>“’Sh! not so loud, Bob. Drop down to the
whisper again. Why, stop and think, how do you
suppose cattle could run along that path where
you nearly took a header, and in the dark too?”</p>

<p>“Shucks! I should say so, Frank. Funny now
I didn’t think of that. Why, to be sure, the
chances are, half of ’em would drop over. It’s
bad enough in daylight, let alone with that tricky
moon, or the darkness. Well, go on; what’s to
be done?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” Frank continued. “The
scheme is this—to wait ’till later in the night;
then perhaps we’ll find a chance to shut the crowd
up in one of the cabins, that biggest one, it might
be. While some kept the rustlers there, the rest
of us, at dawn, could start the herd going. Once
out of this valley they couldn’t hold us from driving
the cattle home.”</p>

<p>“Sounds fine, Frank, and I reckon I can see
your dad’s hand back of the scheme.”</p>

<p>“They hatched it up between ’em, anyhow;
and it struck me as the greatest thing going.
Scotty says he thinks there aren’t more than nine
of the rustlers, without counting the fellow we’ve
got already. But they’re gun fighters, every one,
and would give us a hard battle if it came to that
sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“That means we’ve got to hang around here
all night, doesn’t it, Frank?”</p>

<p>“About that,” replied the other.</p>

<p>“Gee! how can we stand it for hours and
hours?” Bob grunted.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to. Go to sleep whenever<!-- 090.png -->
you feel like it. I’ll promise to wake you up before
the circus starts,” Frank assured him.</p>

<p>“As if I could!” said Bob, reproachfully.</p>

<p>“The others are coming in this direction,”
Frank remarked, still keeping his voice down to
the lowest possible pitch.</p>

<p>“What for?” asked his chum.</p>

<p>“Scotty says,” Frank went on, “the spring is
here that supplies the camp with water; and by
hanging out close by something may be heard. I
can just catch the little sound now that tells me
they’re coming; so don’t be worried, and think it’s
one of the rustlers creeping up on us.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you told me then, Frank, because
it might have bothered me some. Come to think
of it, I reckon the spring must be in that little
bunch of trees over yonder. It seems to be open
from there right into camp.”</p>

<p>“Right again, Bob. You see it pays a fellow
to keep his wits about him, and use his eyes in
the bargain. But here’s Scotty right at my elbow;
and that must be dad coming up on the other
side of you. Enough said, Bob.”</p>

<p>They lapsed into silence. Bob knew that several
unseen forms had ranged close by, and he
could easily understand that these were the
balance of the Circle Ranch cow puncher outfit,
carrying out the directions given by their employer.<!-- 091.png --></p>

<p>Bob had been idly watching the camp, which
was not far away, when he suddenly became
aware of the fact that a single figure had issued
from among the tents and cabins, and was approaching.</p>

<p>He nudged his chum, as though to call his attention
to the fact.</p>

<p>“I see him,” whispered Frank; “and unless
I miss my guess, that is Mendoza himself. I’ve
heard him described often enough to know.”</p>

<p>“But what’s he coming this way for?” asked
Bob, a little nervous at hearing such information,
and with his eyes still glued to the approaching
figure of the Mexican.</p>

<p>“Give it up,” Frank replied; “still, the spring
is over yonder, and perhaps he wants a nice cool
drink, after smoking so much. We’ll watch and
see.”</p>

<p>“Oh! wouldn’t it be great if some of the boys
and Scotty could capture him while he’s bending
down to drink?” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Great stunt,” assented Frank; “but hardly
possible. Too close to the camp; and the first
cry would upset everything. Let’s wait and see
what happens.”</p>

<p>“Look again, Frank!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see another man has started out after
him; and as sure as you live, Bob, we ought to
know that figure.”</p>

<p>
“It looks like an Indian to me,” whispered
the Kentucky lad.</p>

<p>“It is an Indian, and one belonging to the
Moqui tribe up near the Grand Canyon, too.
Look again, Bob. What do you say now?”</p>

<p>“I declare, that’s queer!” said the other.</p>

<p>“Then you think you know him, do you,
Bob?”</p>

<p>“But what could old Havasupai be doing down
here among the rustlers, when we left him headed
back for his village?” Bob ventured.</p>

<p>“Stop and think again, Bob. You remember
when we first made his acquaintance the old fellow
was about to steal one of our horses. When
we caught him he claimed that he was fleeing
from his people because he had done something
that made him an outcast. Perhaps when he went
back they kicked him out again; and in the end
he’s just fallen in with these wild rustlers.”</p>

<p>“But it’s old Havasupai as sure as anything,
Frank!”</p>

<p>“That goes; but drop out now, Bob, you’re
getting too close for us to whisper any more. Just
keep your ears open, and perhaps we’ll hear something
worth while that may explain things.
Silence now, Bob.”</p>

<p>The leading figure had reached a point close
to the clump of small trees from which the sound
of running water proceeded. Bob had seen the<!-- 093.png -->
Mexican look back, several times, as though he
knew the other was following him; but he manifested
no sign of fear.</p>

<p>Entering among the trees he was gone for a
couple of minutes, during which time he undoubtedly
quenched his thirst. Meanwhile the Indian
drew near. He did not attempt to enter the copse,
but waited for the Mexican to come into view
again. It might have been dangerous for anyone
to follow Pedro Mendoza into the shadows, for
he was suspicious of all men and their intentions.</p>

<p>When Mendoza, if the Mexican were really
that person, came forth once more, he found the
old Indian waiting for him.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want with me, Havasupai?”
he asked, in an irritated tone, as
though the interview did not promise to give him
any too much pleasure.</p>

<p>Bob was surprised to hear him speak such good
English, for most of the Mexicans whom he had
met thus far had a sort of <i>patois</i> of their own,
in which Spanish words and phrases were mixed
with American.</p>

<p>But then he had felt the same way when he
heard the Moqui Indian talk, until he remembered
that for years Havasupai had come in
contact with tourists, and in one way or another
picked up considerable information, as well as
the speech of the whites.<!-- 094.png --></p>

<p>“Many moons ago the White Wolf came and
took the daughter of Havasupai away from the
lodges of her people,” the Moqui began; “but
Antelope went willingly, because she would be
the squaw of the white man. Now Havasupai is
sent away to live or die like a dog, because he has
broken the laws of the Moquis, and he would
see again the face of his child before he passes
to the land of the Manitou.”</p>

<p>“So, that’s the reason you hunted me up, was
it, old man?” said the Mexican, with a short,
ugly laugh. “When you told me what had happened
to make you an exile I thought at first you
only wanted shelter and food. Your daughter
is far from here, down in my country. And as
I don’t care to have you meddling around, I refuse
to tell you where she can be found. Go
back to your people; or jump into the sacred
river, for all of me; but see Antelope again you
never will! Get out of my way!”</p>

<p>Bob thought at first the old chief was about
to throw himself on the insulting Mexican. Whatever
was in the mind of the Moqui exile, he
seemed to hold himself in check. The Mexican
walked on back to the camp, never dreaming what
lay in those shadows close by; while the Indian,
wandering still closer to where the Circle Ranch
cowboys lay, sat down on a rock as though to
meditate upon his gloomy outlook.<!-- 095.png --></p>
</div>

<div id='chXI' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XI<br/>JUST BEFORE THE MOON SET</h2>

<p>Bob knew that his chum had been wriggling
past him for some little time, and he guessed that
Frank wanted to communicate with his father.
Now the Kentucky lad could hear them whispering
in the lowest possible tones.</p>

<p>He wondered that the old Moqui, squatted so
close by, did not catch sounds that might arouse
his suspicions; but on looking again Bob saw that
he still sat there on the rock, his Navajo blanket
drawn about his head, the picture of woe, as
though the whole world had turned against him.</p>

<p>It might be the ears of Havasupai were getting
old, and he did not hear as keenly as could a
young warrior. Or possibly he was so wrapped
up in his bitter reflections that he gave small heed
to anything that was passing. Then again it
would be easy to mistake the whispering of Frank
and his father for the twittering of the birds disturbed
on their roosts.</p>

<p>Just why Frank wanted to confer with his
father Bob of course was unable to understand.<!-- 096.png --></p>

<p>He found himself wondering whether the unexpected
presence of this old friend might not have
something to do with his move. Frank was quick
to see an advantage, and use it, when he believed
it would serve his purpose.</p>

<p>And as Bob still lay there in his rather uncomfortable
attitude, waiting for something to happen
whereby the conditions might be changed, he
heard a low, cautious voice, which he recognized
as that of his chum, softly calling:</p>

<p>“Havasupai!”</p>

<p>The gay blanket moved, and the head of the old
Moqui came into view.</p>

<p>“Who calls the Lonely One?” he asked, in
steady tones, as though not quite sure whether
he were dreaming, or hearing the voice of Manitou.</p>

<p>“Come this way, where you see the branch
shaking. It is a friend. Frank, the boy you
met in the Grand Canyon. I want to talk with
you.”</p>

<p>Soft as the words were spoken, they reached
the ear of the Indian. He immediately gained his
feet. There was no such thing as fear about
Havasupai, for without the slightest hesitation he
started directly toward the spot where the quivering
branch guided his steps.</p>

<p>Then a figure rose up to meet him as he entered
the dense shadows. He recognized Frank,
and put out his dusky and withered palm with the
Indian salutation.</p>

<p>“Speak in a whisper, chief,” Frank said, as
he took the hand of the Moqui; “for we don’t
want the rustlers to know we are here. They
have stolen my father’s cattle, and we have come
to get them back, even if we have to fight for
them.”</p>

<p>The old Indian grunted. Evidently he could
easily comprehend the situation; for he must
know what occupation the man followed who had
carried his daughter away from the lodges of her
people, and now refused to let him see her face
for the very last time.</p>

<p>He had already seen that there were many
others in hiding close by, men who were dressed
as cattle drivers, and who carried arms which they
evidently knew how to use.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you can help us, Chief,” Frank went
on; and from this Bob knew that it was about
this matter his chum and the colonel had been
whispering.</p>

<p>“Ugh! Frank much friend Havasupai, long
go. Not forget. How can help?” was what the
old Moqui said.</p>

<p>“We heard what the rustler said to you,”
Frank went on eagerly, though carefully. “He
scorns you because your people have sent you out
to die like a dog or a coyote. Help us to trap<!-- 098.png -->
Mendoza and his men. We would shut them
up in the cabins while we run off our stock. And
as you are allowed in the camp, you might be of
great help to us. Will you do it, Havasupai? If
we win out, my father says he will look after you,
and see to it that you find Antelope again.”</p>

<p>The old Moqui did not hesitate. Anyone who
would promise that was his friend. Besides, he
doubtless secretly hated and despised Mendoza,
and would be glad to see him tricked.</p>

<p>“Tell me what to do, Frank; Havasupai
knows your tongue is straight. He will trust
you,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Here is my father,” the boy went on; “who
owns the Circle Ranch stock farm. Come a
little further into the bushes, where you can speak
with him. We must be careful not to be heard by
any of those in the camp.”</p>

<p>Upon that invitation the Indian folded his
blanket calmly about him, and stalked in among
the bushes. He did not know what sort of reception
might await him; but he was a seasoned
warrior, and could not flinch from danger. From
the time he could pull a bow-string he had been
accustomed to looking peril in the face, and smiling
at its terrors. In his old age, then, it could
not be expected that his nature would change.</p>

<p>For a long time he remained there, holding a
conversation with Colonel Haywood and Scotty.
Perhaps the leaders of the cowboys picked up
more or less valuable information through this
channel, for the Indian was willing to turn upon
the man who had treated him so scurvily.</p>

<p>Bob had settled down to watching again when
he saw a figure leave the shelter of the thicket,
and head straight for the camp. Of course he
knew that this was the old Moqui. No danger
of Havasupai betraying their presence. That
promise of the stockman in connection with finding
his daughter for him would serve to hold
him loyal, even if gratitude toward the two boys
for what they had done before was lacking in his
breast.</p>

<p>“What time do you think it can be, Frank?”
asked Bob, when his chum once again cuddled
down alongside him.</p>

<p>The prairie boy, through instinct, cast his eyes
upwards. He was able to tell what Bob wanted
to know by the position of the moon. Had that
been lacking, then the low-lying star that trembled
above the hill-top to the west would have given
him the information he wanted. Nature holds
a thousand secrets that become as an open book
to those who have learned how to read her
signs.</p>

<p>“About eleven by the watch,” Frank replied,
readily, after that one glance up at the starry
heavens.<!-- 100.png --></p>

<p>“And do we have to keep this thing up till
nearly dawn?” asked the other.</p>

<p>“Oh! I reckon it isn’t quite so bad as that,”
replied Frank. “Dad says we will draw back
some and get a little sleep. Around about an
hour before daybreak we get back here, and
then we can all listen for the signal of the
Moqui.”</p>

<p>“What will that tell us, Frank?”</p>

<p>“That the trap is ready to be sprung. In
other words, Bob, that the rustlers are snug in
the bunk-house there. When we learn that,
Scotty and his boys will creep up, close the door,
and fasten it, ditto the windows; and then we’ll
be ready to get the stock moving with the peep of
day.”</p>

<p>“Say, won’t they be a hot bunch, though, when
they find out what’s happened to ’em?” Bob remarked.</p>

<p>“That goes without saying,” his chum answered.
“Perhaps they may try to break out. In
that case there’s going to be a rough-house time.
But Mendoza is more cunning than bold, dad
says; and he believes that when the rustler knows
how he’s in a fix, he’ll keep quiet, and let us run
off the stock, rather than risk his neck trying to
defend it.”</p>

<p>“You said we might get a little sleep, didn’t
you, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and by the way you keep on yawning, I
can see you need it, all right. And as I hear some
of the boys making a move, it looks like they
meant to follow out the idea, and get further away
from the camp.”</p>

<p>“But tell me why they want to go back, when
this is as good cover as we can find anywhere?”
Bob asked.</p>

<p>“One man will stay here to keep tabs on what
is happening in camp,” Frank answered, as if he
had it all figured out in his own mind, and did
not hesitate about posting his companion. “But
it’s safer for the others to sleep far enough away,
so if there happens to be a big snorer among ’em,
he won’t tell the rustlers that we’ve come to town
to pay them a visit.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I see now; and I’m glad I’m not one of
that kind, Frank.”</p>

<p>The two chums moved back with the rest. A
short time later they were gathered in a retired
spot, where the stockman took the pains to explain
the conditions, so that everyone might be
fully posted.</p>

<p>“Now get what sleep you can, boys,” he finished.
“A few hours won’t be long; and when
the right time comes, we’ll move out on the firing
line once more. Try and keep from making any
more noise that you can help. No telling what
might happen, you know. And I have heard men<!-- 102.png -->
snore loud enough to almost make the house
shake.”</p>

<p>They dropped just where they happened to be
at the time; and each one after his own way
sought the sleep needed to put them in shape for
work.</p>

<p>The last Bob knew he was looking up through
the branches of a tree at the bright moon,
glimpses of which crept in through the interlaced
leaves. Then he lost himself entirely, confident
that those who kept watch would see to it
that no evil befell the sleepers.</p>

<p>Of course it was Frank who gently shook Bob,
and thus awoke him. Left to himself it was
doubtful when the Kentucky boy would have
opened his eyes again, until the sun, rising over
the ridge in the east, told of another day.</p>

<p>Bob sat up, rubbing his eyes with his knuckles.</p>

<p>“Keep still, Bob! Remember where you are!”
said Frank, quickly; for he judged that as yet the
other did not realize the nature of the situation;
and there was always a possibility that he might
call out before he understood.</p>

<p>“Whew! I had forgotten, for a fact,”
breathed Bob. “Is it time, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Some of them are moving, and it woke me
up,” came the reply. “Yes, there’s Scotty going
around now, and shaking every sleeper. We’re
going to move up, Bob. See, the moon is low<!-- 103.png -->
down over the western ridge, and it must be about
four o’clock.”</p>

<p>“And I’ve been asleep over four hours, then;
why, it didn’t feel more’n a few winks,” remarked
Bob, astonished at the truth; “but I feel
better, Frank, and ready to do my part in the
game. So let’s get a move on, as the others are
doing.”</p>
</div>

<div id='chXII' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XII<br/>BOTTLING UP THE RUSTLERS</h2>

<p>“How do you like it, Bob, as far as you’ve
gone?” asked Frank, as they prepared to follow
after the others, who were slowly moving off in
Indian file, pressing close to the earth, and looking
not unlike a string of great cats, creeping upon
their quarry.</p>

<p>“Is that a fair question, Frank?” said the Kentucky
boy, with a sign of hesitation in his low
voice. “Because if it is, I’m bound to answer
you straight.”</p>

<p>“You don’t care much for this sort of thing,
then; is that it?” asked the other.</p>

<p>“Well, between us honestly, then, I don’t seem
to,” came the reply. “You see, when I looked
forward to it, the idea seemed rather fine; but
somehow the experience feels different. And,
Frank, I hope when I say that, you won’t believe
for a minute it’s because I’m timid.”</p>

<p>“I know better than that, Bob. You mean, I
take it, that this thing of hunting <i>men</i> somehow
doesn’t seem to appeal to you?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I mean, Frank,” replied the
other, hastily. “It’s hard to explain how I feel,
but I’d rather ten times over be galloping across
the plains on my good old Domino, than crawling
all over these mountains, looking for rustlers, and
feeling ugly in my heart because they’ve robbed
Circle Ranch of its prize herd.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t blame the rest of us for wanting
to get those cattle back again, do you, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Well, I should say <i>not</i>!” Bob exclaimed,
with so much feeling that his chum had to press a
warning finger to his lips; “and remember, that
I’m just as eager about turning the trick as you
can be. Only,” and there was a wistful tone to
his voice now, “I’ll be awful glad when it’s
over.”</p>

<p>Frank chuckled softly.</p>

<p>“Looks like you’d never make a very good
sheriff, or marshal, Bob,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“I don’t reckon I would,” replied the other.
“Perhaps it’s because I’ve got too soft a heart.
But Frank, if I saw the biggest scoundrel that
ever went unpunished nagging a little chap, or a
girl, I think I’d jump in, and try to hold him
up.”</p>

<p>“Don’t I know it, old fellow?” the other
hastened to declare. “Haven’t I seen you do
just that same thing more’n once? But we’d
better cut this talk out now, Bob, and get along
because they’ve all gone but us; and we want to
see what goes on, whether we have a hand in it
or not.”</p>

<p>“Right we do, Frank; lead the way!”</p>

<p>The two saddle boys started to follow the rest,
creeping along as stealthily as the best of them,
and heading for the camp of the cattle thieves.</p>

<p>The night was near its close, just as Frank had
declared when mentioning the fact that it must
be after four o’clock. And the moon would presently
vanish behind the summit of the ridge that
marked the cap of the western range, of which
Thunder Mountain was a part.</p>

<p>When Frank and his chum arrived within seeing
distance of the several cabins comprising the
camp of the rustlers, all seemed quiet. The fires
had been allowed to die down, so that there was
only a little glow where they had been.</p>

<p>From the direction of the big corral where the
cattle were kept, such sounds as would indicate
the presence of a herd could be heard by ears accustomed
to the various noises of a ranch.</p>

<p>Of course the boys were more concerned in the
bunk-house than anything else, for it was in this
quarter the excitement would presently center.</p>

<p>“The door seems to be wide open,” whispered
Bob, in his chum’s ear.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” came the faint reply. “We
expected that, because the night has been warmer<!-- 107.png -->
than usual. But make up your mind that’s all
been thought of, and if you keep your eyes
fastened on that doorway, perhaps you’ll see
something moving before long.”</p>

<p>Frank would not have spoken at this length
only that he had his lips close to the ear of his
companion; and had anyone been five feet away
it is doubtful whether they could have distinguished
his voice from the sighing of the soft
night wind through the branches of the cedars, or
the aspens, near by.</p>

<p>As Bob lay there with his eyes glued upon the
dark doorway of the big bunk-house, boylike, he
allowed his thoughts to stray far away. And as
might be expected, he thought, among other
things, of the missing knife, which had never
seemed half so valuable to him as when he found
it gone.</p>

<p>What Frank had said about his using it to cut
up the deer several days ago appeared to have
made considerable impression on Bob’s mind. He
was trying now with all his might, to mentally
look upon that scene again, in the hope that in
this way he could follow his actions, and find out
just what he had done with the knife, after finishing
his work.</p>

<p>In vain did he try, however. There seemed to
be just one place up to which he was able to carry
himself, and there he stuck, every time.<!-- 108.png --></p>

<p>But the minutes were passing. Surely it ought
to be nearly time for things to begin happening.
He had kept his eyes on that open door; but so far
nothing had rewarded his scrutiny.</p>

<p>What were they waiting for? Had the old
Moqui promised to make his appearance, to tell
them that all was well, and every one of the rustlers
sound asleep?</p>

<p>What was that—Frank nudging him in the
side? Then his chum evidently wished to call
his attention to something that was taking
place.</p>

<p>For the first time Bob had removed his eyes
from the doorway, to glance around the camp;
and warned by this signal, he hastened to turn his
attention once more in the quarter where he anticipated
discovering something.</p>

<p>He was not disappointed this time, for he could
certainly see a movement there. The moon’s
rays did not happen to be shining on that side
of the cabin, so that he could not see as distinctly
as he would like; but Bob knew that the object
must be the figure of a man.</p>

<p>What if one of the rustlers had arisen, and
thought to start the fire for an early breakfast?
That would “play hob”, as Bob expressed it in
his own mind, with the carefully laid plans of the
stockman.</p>

<p>But he felt pretty certain that the one who had<!-- 109.png -->
appeared in the doorway must be the Moqui warrior.
His actions indicated stealth, and a desire
to keep from doing anything calculated to arouse
the sleepers.</p>

<p>Looking closer, Bob believed he could see the
unknown one closing the heavy door of the bunk-house.
This caused him to remember what had
passed through his mind at the time he scrutinized
this same building, when the glow of the fires
lighted it up. It had reminded him of a fort,
with its heavy log walls, stout shutters that could
be fastened over the windows, and cumbersome
door.</p>

<p>Perhaps in building it the rustlers may have had
some such idea in view. They were at war with
the cowmen of the country, and at any time might
find themselves attacked by a force of indignant
cowboys ready to avenge the daring raids of the
past. At such a time a fortress in the valley
was apt to prove of considerable value, and might
save their lives.</p>

<p>Yes, the man in the shadows had now closed
the door, beyond all doubt. He seemed to be doing
something more, which Bob could easily imagine
must mean that he was fastening a stout
rope in such a way that those within would be
powerless to open the door.</p>

<p>Bob remembered the small openings that served
as windows. How could they be secured against<!-- 110.png -->
the exit of the rustlers, aroused by the lowing of
the herd after it was put in motion; or even before?</p>

<p>Strange how a sly fox should venture so near
the camp, even at this still hour of the night; or
could that little bark have come from the lips
of the Indian, to serve as a signal?</p>

<p>“Come on!” whispered Frank in his ear; and
immediately Bob jumped to the conclusion that
his guess was the truth, after all, and that it had
been the Moqui who so closely imitated the call
of the red fox.</p>

<p>Figures arose here and there. The eager cowboys
had been waiting for this sound with a fever
in their blood. But there was no confusion, no
stumbling, as they swiftly advanced, ready to take
a hand in the game.</p>

<p>Colonel Haywood and Scotty had made all
arrangements beforehand. Each man knew exactly
what was expected of him, and they moved
like the parts of a well oiled machine.</p>

<p>There were two of those small openings, one
on either side of the cabin. The heavy wooden
shutters could be closed easily enough; but, being
intended for fastening inside, it was not so
easy to make them secure from without.</p>

<p>Two heavy posts that had been chopped for
some purpose by the rustlers having caught the
eye of the stockman, he judged they would be just<!-- 111.png -->
the thing to hold the shutters closed, if placed in
a slanting position from without.</p>

<p>Bob saw men run lightly forward, pick up these
posts, and after the shutters had been quietly
swung over, plant the braces in such a way that
no effort from within could displace them.</p>

<p>And it seemed to him this had hardly been accomplished
before there came a shout from inside
the cabin, that told of alarm.<!-- 112.png --></p>
</div>

<div id='chXIII' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br/>THE PRISONERS OF THE BUNK-HOUSE</h2>

<p>That one yell was immediately followed by
others from inside the cabin. Then came a tremendous
thumping on the door, accompanied by
more outcries.</p>

<p>The cowboys without, not being able to hold
themselves in check any longer, started to shoot;
and the rattle of firearms was the first sign that
told the prisoners of the bunk-house something of
the truth.</p>

<p>Colonel Haywood knew that he was dealing
with desperate men. He realized that nothing
must be neglected in the effort to hold them prisoners,
until the cattle had been driven out of the
mountains, and within the zone of safety.</p>

<p>Upon the door of the cabin he pounded with
the butt end of a revolver.</p>

<p>“Mendoza!” he called, in a tone of authority.</p>

<p>The clamor both within and without ceased as
if by magic. The rustlers were consumed with
a burning desire to know what it all meant. On
the other hand, Scotty and the rest of the punchers<!-- 113.png -->
knew that their employer wished to give the
leader of the rustlers warning.</p>

<p>“Who calls me?” came from within; and Bob
knew that it was the chief rustler who spoke,
although bitter anger filled his voice.</p>

<p>“This is Colonel Haywood, Mendoza; you
know me!” continued the stockman.</p>

<p>A laugh greeted the announcement.</p>

<p>“So you have come to reclaim your strays, is
that it, Colonel Haywood?” mocked the Mexican;
“well, they are all safe, but a few heifers
that grew dizzy climbing along the trail, and
dropped over. But you will never take them out
of this valley.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to make a big try for it, just
as soon as daylight comes; and mark my words,
Mendoza, the men who try to oppose us are going
to get hurt,” the stockman continued, sternly.</p>

<p>“Wait and see who laughs last,” mocked the
other. “You think you’ve got us shut up here
like rats in a trap. Perhaps you mean to keep
guard over us until the last of the steers has been
safely run out of the hills; those belonging to us
as well as your own?”</p>

<p>“You are good at guessing, Mendoza,” replied
the stockman; “for that is exactly what we plan
to do.”</p>

<p>“And you think we will tamely stay in here
while you are robbing us of our property, we who<!-- 114.png -->
are armed, and do not know the meaning of the
word fear? Senor, you have another guess coming!”
continued the man behind the door.</p>

<p>“All the same,” Colonel Haywood went on,
sternly; “not one of your men will dare show his
face outside that cabin, until those I leave here on
guard hear the signal that we have reached the
plain with the herd. They have orders to shoot,
Mendoza, and to make every bullet count. It is
a long score they have to settle with you; and if
you are wise you will hesitate to give them the
chance they have been waiting for these many
moons.”</p>

<p>The rustler chief laughed again.</p>

<p>“I don’t like the sound of that laugh,” Bob
said to Frank, as the two stood where no stray
shot from the besieged cabin might reach them;
“somehow it makes me think of a hyena I once
saw at a circus. When he howled it sent the cold
creeps up and down my back.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” admitted Frank. “They say
Mendoza is as sly as any fox that ever crept into
a hen house, and carried off a fat prize, with all
sorts of traps set to catch him. Somehow I just
can’t get rid of the notion that while we seem to
have him in a pickle right now, he’s got a string
he means to pull, that’s going to surprise us disagreeably.”</p>

<p>“Say, you make me feel bad, Frank,” declared<!-- 115.png -->
the other; “I hope you’re mistaken about that.
But listen to the racket they’re kicking up inside
there! Do you think they’ll break out, and tackle
our fellows?”</p>

<p>“Not much they won’t,” laughed Frank.
“They know what cowboys are, once they get
their guns going. And remember, they have no
idea how many of us there are. How can they
tell that there are not forty fellows here, just waiting
for them to break out?”</p>

<p>“Then that’s all put on for show, the pounding
and shouting?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Huh!” snorted Frank; “they have to make
a bluff of being hungry to get at our crowd; but
all the same, you mark my word, it’ll be some
time before the first rustler shows even the tip of
his nose where Scotty or any of our boys can get
a crack at him.”</p>

<p>“Frank, am I right, and is that the first peep
of dawn over yonder in the east?”</p>

<p>“No mistake about that, my boy; morning is
close at hand; and before another hour I reckon
we’ll be pushing the herd over the back trail,”
Frank replied.</p>

<p>“There will be several men left here to hold
the rustlers in the cabin; is that the programme,
Frank?”</p>

<p>“Just what; and you can easily understand that
they will be men chosen for their staying qualities,”<!-- 116.png -->
Frank answered. “For you know it’s going
to be something of a ticklish job; because when
once they get the signal, and quit here, the rustlers
will burrow out in no time. And, being wild for
revenge, they’ll chase after the boys, and give
them a running fight all through the mountain
trails.”</p>

<p>“How about them shooting now, through
cracks or holes in the cabin walls?” asked the
Kentucky boy.</p>

<p>“They might,” replied his chum. “I reckon
they’ve got some gun-holes here and there for just
that purpose. But if they know what’s good for
them, they’ll go slow about wounding any of our
boys. Dad can hardly hold the fellows in now,
and it would only take one match to set off the
magazine; and there’s no telling what terrible
things would happen then.”</p>

<p>“There goes your father and Bart now, toward
the corral,” Bob remarked.</p>

<p>“Yes, and some of the boys trailing after,”
Frank added. “It looks like they expected to get
the herd in motion as soon as the trail can be
easily seen. Dad is just wild to drive his stock
clear of this valley; though some day I expect
he’ll be wanting to use it on his own hook, after
the rustlers have been driven out of this part of
the country; because it’s a boss place to winter a
herd.”</p>

<p>“We go with the punchers who will drive, I
suppose, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Sure we do,” replied the other, a little regretfully.
“I tried to coax dad to let us stay
back; but he just wouldn’t hear of it.”</p>

<p>“And for one I’m glad he didn’t say yes,” Bob
spoke promptly. “I don’t feel that I’d like to
stay here, and have a hand in that game of hide
and seek you say will take place when the siege
of the bunk-house is raised, and the rustlers rush
out like a swarm of angry bees. No, I think I’d
be happier driving the herd; though if they came
up with us, and tried to take the cattle back, I
hope I’d fight like a true Kentuckian ought.”</p>

<p>“Oh! once we strike the level with the herd
we’ll see no more of the rustlers,” Frank assured
him confidently. “And, what’s more, you can
take it from me that as soon as dad gets home he’ll
stir up all the stockmen in this part of the State.
It’s going to get too warm for Mendoza and his
crowd on this side of the border; and they’ll have
to vamoose, if they want to keep alive.”</p>

<p>Once at the corral the boys found that, as daylight
came on, the cowboys were getting busy indeed.
They recognized the best part of the herd
as their property; but besides these there seemed
to be fully as many other cattle. Mendoza had
claimed these as his lawful possession; but no one
believed him; for it was found that in every case<!-- 118.png -->
the brands on full-grown cattle had been altered.
Only a few partly grown animals bore the single
star that seemed to be the trade mark of the hidden valley ranch.</p>

<p>The last the boys saw of the bunk-house, all
appeared serene there. No doubt the inmates
were watching through cracks and holes, to see
what the cowboys were doing; but thus far they
had made no serious attempt to force a way out,
knowing, as they did, that a number of good shots
were posted behind the other cabin, ready to give
them a very hot reception upon their appearance.</p>

<p>It was now light enough to make a start, and
the cries of the cowboys began to cause a movement
in the herd. The barbed wire corral had
been cut, so that the animals were easily driven
forth, and headed on the trail that would, in a
short time, bring the vanguard to the neck of the
bottle—that narrow pass through which they
must apparently proceed in order to leave the valley.</p>

<p>All seemed to be going smoothly, and the boys,
who were keeping pretty much together, could see
nothing menacing in the conditions around them.
The country was exceedingly wild, and a few daring
men would be able to break up the drive, could
they be posted on the slope of the mountain.
But the boys felt sure that all the rustlers, except<!-- 119.png -->
the vidette who had been first captured, were shut
up in the bunk-house, and hence beyond power of
doing any harm.</p>

<p>Still, somehow, Bob could not quite get that
scornful laugh, as well as the mocking words of
Mendoza, out of his mind.</p>

<p>“He meant something by it, I’m sure of that,”
he was saying to himself for the fifth time at
least, as he stalked along, doing his share of
driving the herd toward the outlet of the secret
valley back of Thunder Mountain.</p>

<p>This being on foot galled the cowboys very
much. If there is anything a puncher dislikes it
is being compelled to play his part without a
horse. Habit so accustoms him to being mounted
that he really seems to be a part of his steed,
once he flings himself across the animal’s
back.</p>

<p>“Ten minutes more, and we ought to have the
leaders starting through that little gap, hadn’t
we, Frank?” Bob asked, after a time.</p>

<p>“Just what we ought,” the other replied; and
hardly had he spoken before he staggered back,
while Bob almost fell over with the shock.</p>

<p>It seemed to the two boys as though the cap
of Thunder Mountain, long suspected of having
been a volcano centuries in the past, had been
blown sky-high by some tremendous internal
force. There was a heavy blast that seemed to<!-- 120.png -->
make the very earth quiver under their feet. The
cattle bellowed, and shrank fearfully into a compact
mass, refusing to go further along the trail.
And the loud cries of the cowboys told that they,
too, had been astounded by the explosion that
seemed so mysterious.<!-- 121.png --></p>
</div>

<div id='chXIV' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br/>SHUT IN</h2>

<p>“An earthquake!”</p>

<p>Perhaps, after all, it was not so very strange
that Bob should give utterance to this exclamation.
He had been thrown to the ground, and
with considerable violence too. The consequence
of this rough treatment was a shortage of breath
as he began to scramble to his feet again, though
even this did not prevent his excited outcry.</p>

<p>The cattle had been frightened by the sudden,
fearful noise, and the trembling of the earth.
They were bellowing madly, and showing all the
signs that generally go before a stampede.</p>

<p>The instinct of a stockman must have overcome
the alarm Colonel Haywood naturally experienced
himself at this unexpected happening.</p>

<p>“Get busy, boys!” he shouted. “Take care
of the stock first. Get them milling, or we’ll have
a stampede, and lose the whole bunch!”</p>

<p>The nearest cowboy passed the word on to the
next. Above the racket then arose the cheery
cries of the drivers, as they started upon the customary<!-- 122.png -->
tactics to get the animals wheeling in a
circle, so as to prevent a mad rush.</p>

<p>There was no succeeding shock. After that
one crash there came a silence. Birds that had
been singing in the trees flew wildly away, but
their songs were hushed. Here and there an animal
could be seen dashing away, or slinking
through the underbrush, as though half dazed
by the concussion.</p>

<p>Presently it was seen, much to the relief of
Frank and Bob, who were doing their best to assist,
that the cattle had been held. They were
moving in a big circle, “milling” after the most
approved methods of the range, and doing it in
spite of the limited open space at the command
of the cowboy band.</p>

<p>“That danger is past, anyhow,” Frank remarked,
as he wiped the perspiration from his
forehead.</p>

<p>“But we may have another shock, Frank,” said
Bob, nervously, as he looked upward toward the
peak of Thunder Mountain. “They say these
things never go singly; and the first shake isn’t
always the hardest of the lot, either. But I don’t
see any smoke hanging over the cap up there,
Frank!”</p>

<p>“Smoke?” echoed the other boy, looking puzzled.</p>

<p>“Why, yes; there’s always a lot of it, you<!-- 123.png -->
know, when a volcano starts to knocking things
around,” Bob went on.</p>

<p>It was a strange time to laugh, but all the same
Frank seemed unable to keep from doing it.</p>

<p>“So that’s the idea you’ve got, is it, Bob?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>“Sure it is, and from what I heard some of
the boys call out, I reckon I’m not the only one
to believe it,” Bob made answer, without hesitation.</p>

<p>“And you don’t see any smoke up yonder
around the top of our old friend, Thunder Mountain,
eh?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“If there was any, it’s cleared away,” the other
continued, “which I take it would be queer; because
once they start to pour out ashes, lava and
fire, these volcanoes keep it up for days and
weeks.”</p>

<p>“And seems to me the cap still fits snug up
there, Bob; it doesn’t look like anything had happened
to blow it into a thousand pieces, as far as
I can see.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what sets me to wondering, Frank.
But you don’t act as if you took any stock in the
idea?”</p>

<p>“Well, to tell the honest truth, Bob, I don’t!”
declared Frank.</p>

<p>“But it couldn’t have been that geyser in the
mountain, could it?” Bob went on.</p>

<p>“I should say not. No geyser in the world,
or a dozen of the biggest together, could have
made all that fierce row, and shaken the earth as
we felt it tremble. But Bob, though I didn’t happen
to <i>see</i> smoke, for I was tumbled down just as
you were, I have <i>smelled</i> it since!”</p>

<p>“You have?” burst out the Kentucky lad, eagerly.
“Then that proves my idea, doesn’t it,
Frank?”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” returned the other, dryly. “In the
first place, notice that the wind doesn’t happen to
be coming from the direction of Thunder Mountain
at all, and smoke couldn’t reach us from
there. It’s straight ahead, in the direction of the
little gap, or pass, we took to get into this valley,
and through which all cattle have to be driven,
to enter or leave!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” burst from Bob’s lips, as he seemed
to grasp something of what his chum was hinting.</p>

<p>“Another thing,” Frank went on, “there was
something about the smell of that same smoke to
remind me of powder, dynamite or such things,
and not the gas they say always comes with an outbreak
from a volcano.”</p>

<p>Bob stared at him. So great was his astonishment
that his mouth even opened, and Frank was
forced to smile at the picture his chum presented.</p>

<p>“Powder!” ejaculated Bob. “Then Frank,
you believe that awful explosion was caused by
human hands, and not Nature: is that it?”</p>

<p>Frank nodded.<!-- 125.png --></p>

<p>“It wasn’t the smash of a volcano breaking
loose,” Bob went on, voicing his surprise; “we
won’t be drowned, or burned to cinders in a flood
of lava flowing down the side of the mountain—it
isn’t even a fierce landslide that’s carried away
half the old ridge; but just an every-day explosion—some
miners, perhaps, blown up with all their
stuff?”</p>

<p>“Hold on, there; you’re going a step too far,
Bob. I never had miners in my head when I said
that,” Frank remarked.</p>

<p>“But who else would carry explosives around
with them, and carelessly let the whole outfit go
up in one big smash?” demanded Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s Mendoza, for one,” the other
said, quietly.</p>

<p>“Mendoza? the rustler?” echoed Bob.</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“But Frank, you must be joking, because he’s
shut up in that bunk-house good and tight. How
could Mendoza get ahead of us to the pass, and
touch off that big mine?”</p>

<p>Even as Bob was saying this the expression on
his face changed. Some sudden idea had found a
speedy lodgement in his mind; and without waiting
for his chum to make any reply to his question
he went on:</p>

<p>“Oh! now I see what you mean, Frank; he
must have had a mine planted, connected with his<!-- 126.png -->
old cabin by a wire, and a battery! He fired the
charge from there; is that what you want to tell
me, Frank?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I believe,” replied the other,
firmly.</p>

<p>“But why would he do that, Frank? Do you
think the miserable coward expected to blow us
all up?” demanded Bob, with considerable heat.</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t know about that,” Frank went
on, slowly, as though loath to believe the Mexican
could be so vindictive; “but I do think Mendoza
wants to close the neck of the bottle here, so that
dad can’t take his cattle out of this valley.”</p>

<p>“That sounds just like all I’ve heard of Mendoza!”
cried Bob. “I wouldn’t put it past him
one minute. But Frank, he took big chances of
blowing us up at the same time. If we’d been
closer, we might have been hit by some of the
rocks I heard falling like hail all around!”</p>

<p>“That was our lookout, and Mendoza wasn’t
going to trouble himself about making sure none
of us were hurt. Stop and think, Bob; you’ll remember
how he told dad, with one of his laughs,
how we would never take the stock out of this
valley? Well, he believes he’s fixed it that way
right now!”</p>

<p>“Then we’re in a nice pickle, aren’t we?” lamented
the other saddle boy. “If he’s blown
that little pass into a ruin, and cut off our only way<!-- 127.png -->
for going out, we’ll never get the cattle through.”</p>

<p>“Never is a long time, Bob; just wait till my
dad gets to work. He always rises to his best
when in a hole like this. There he is, coming
this way with Bart and Scotty. Perhaps he hasn’t
caught on as well as I did; so let’s join them to
find out.”</p>

<p>It proved, however, that Colonel Haywood
had guessed the true solution of that fearful explosion
just as his son had, through smelling the
smoke, and putting several things together.</p>

<p>He had been telling the others his opinion, and
Scotty was getting ready to push his way forward,
in order to investigate. The others would all be
needed to keep the cattle quiet; though by degrees
the fright of the animals was wearing off, as they
heard the reassuring calls of the cow punchers
around them.</p>

<p>For a short time the party exchanged ideas,
and the stockman was pleased to find that Frank
had appreciated the situation so fully.</p>

<p>“As soon as I can spare a man I mean to send
him back to the camp,” the stockman remarked.
“Our two fellows will be wondering what terrible
thing has happened; and, not hearing anything
from us, might be tempted to give over guarding
the rustlers. It would only add to our troubles
if the thieves broke loose, and started to play a
sharp-shooting game, hiding along the side of the<!-- 128.png -->
mountain, and pestering us with their fire. But
first, Scotty, go ahead and find out if what we suspect
is true.”</p>

<p>Accordingly the cowboy started off. Duty
with him took the lead above everything else.
No matter what might lie beyond, once Scotty had
his orders he stood ready to obey.</p>

<p>Bart hurried back to assist his men in keeping
the herd intact, until they could decide on their
next move, which would not be until the skirmisher
had reported.</p>

<p>“If the pass has been blown up, what will we
do then?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“That depends on how bad the wreck is,” replied
the stockman, calmly. “If it is possible to
dig a passage in a reasonable time, we may start
to work.”</p>

<p>“But if it’s out of the question, sir, will we have
to abandon the herd after all our fine work tracking
them here?” Bob went on, plainly disturbed.</p>

<p>“We won’t cross that bridge till we come to
it,” the Colonel said, with a tightening of his lips
that Frank knew of old; “but you can depend on
it, my boy, I’ll never abandon my cattle so long
as there’s any chance to save them. Our Fall
round-up is due shortly now, and I’d feel pretty
blue if one-third of my whole stock had been
abandoned up here, to be slaughtered by these
rustlers in revenge, after we left for home.”</p>

<p>“Because, if we couldn’t get them out, they
would be in the same fix, I reckon you mean, sir?”
Bob suggested.</p>

<p>“Exactly; and Mendoza would rather kill
every steer and cow and yearling than know they
had fallen into my hands again. But Scotty
ought to be back here very soon now, when we
will at least know the worst,” and the stockman
looked anxiously up the valley in the direction
where he knew the pass lay.</p>

<p>“And there’s something moving right now,
dad!” cried Frank, whose keen vision had enabled
him to catch sight of the object before any
one else.</p>

<p>“That’s Scotty, all right,” pursued Colonel
Haywood. “Now he’s making motions, cowboy
fashion, and I don’t like the news he’s sending me.
It looks like we’re up against it, good and hard.”</p>

<p>“You mean he is telling you the pass has been
blown up, sir?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Seems as if that must be what he means; but
wait till he gets here, and we’ll know the worst,”
concluded the rancher; his set jaws and flashing
eyes telling how the desperate situation was arousing
that old spirit of “never say die” which in
times past had always marked his work, and been
the means of his present success.</p>

<p>The cowboy came hurrying along as fast as the
uneven ground would permit. Straight toward<!-- 130.png -->
the little group he advanced—for Bart, the foreman,
had again joined the others, eager, to hear
the news the scout was bringing back.</p>

<p>Frank knew before a word was spoken that
Scotty had made a disagreeable discovery, which
would put them to great trouble so far as getting
the stock out of the valley was concerned. Hence,
he was nerved to hear bad news.</p>

<p>“How about it, Scotty?” asked Colonel Haywood,
as the other arrived close to where the
others stood.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t ’a been worse, sir,” replied the disgusted
cowboy, shrugging his broad shoulders.</p>

<p>“Then the pass has been blown up, and filled
with rubbish?” continued the other.</p>

<p>“Filled so high that a month wouldn’t open it
again to let even an Old Baldy climb over. We’re
sure up agin it, Colonel, this time!” declared
Scotty, scowling.<!-- 131.png --></p>
</div>

<div id='chXV' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XV<br/>BALDY’S HOOF POINTS THE WAY</h2>

<p>“It’s a bad outlook, but we’re not the kind to
give up easily,” said the stockman, grimly.</p>

<p>Bob, who had been much dejected by the news
which the cowboy trailer brought, plucked up
fresh hope at these words from the rancher.</p>

<p>Frank, too, was able to grasp at little rays of
encouragement.</p>

<p>“At the worst,” he said resolutely, “we might
hold the fort here, and send for help. Some of
the other stockmen, learning that we had Mendoza
cooped up, would rush assistance; and in
time we might clean out the pass.”</p>

<p>“Bully!” cried Bob, impulsively.</p>

<p>“That’s true,” the Colonel remarked, “but
lots of things could happen before that same help
arrived, which would mean several days at least.
And when dealing with Mendoza, you never can
be sure that you can put your finger on him when
you think you’ve got him. Perhaps he might
manage to slip out of that cabin to-night; and then
there would be warm times around here.”</p>

<p>“One thing’s sure,” Scotty declared, with a
shake of his head, “they must ’a had a fierce lot
of dynamite under that pass. You never did see
such a piled-up lot o’ rocks in your born days. I
had to rub my eyes, and pinch myself, to believe
there ever had been an opening there, through
which we came into this here valley, an’ all that
stock, too.”</p>

<p>“Mendoza always had a reputation for doing
things to the limit,” remarked the stockman.
“He knew that it would be useless damaging the
pass only a little; so he made the mine a big one.
I never heard anything like that detonation before.
But we’ll all try and think up some way
of beating the rustler at his own game.”</p>

<p>“If we only had the stuff,” remarked Bob,
“perhaps we might clean out the pass the same
way he filled it!”</p>

<p>“By an explosion, you mean?” said Frank.
“Well, I reckon that would only make bad worse,
and do no good; for there isn’t any pass there
now under the rocks, if what Scotty tells us is
true.”</p>

<p>“What the Colonel said goes with me,” remarked
the foreman.</p>

<p>“You mean about holding the fort here, and
sending for help?” asked the stockman.</p>

<p>“Yep, that’s the idea, sir,” replied Bart. “We
might set to work and make prisoners of the rustlers,<!-- 133.png -->
you see, first of all. And once we got that
crowd where they wouldn’t bother us any, we
could stay here, and wait till help came.”</p>

<p>“If only there was some other way to get out
of this queer little valley!” said Bob, dismally.</p>

<p>“Well, there isn’t, ’cause you see Mendoza
would know about it; and he always used the pass
that’s been blowed up,” Scotty argued.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure about that, Scotty!”</p>

<p>All turned and looked at Frank when he said
this. Even his father seemed surprised to hear
his words. And there was a faint smile on the
boy’s face to indicate that some bright thought
might be occupying his mind; something with
which he may have been wrestling lately, while
listening to the conversation around him.</p>

<p>“How’s that, Frank?” Scotty demanded.</p>

<p>“Why, you seemed so positive about there not
being any other way for cattle getting out of here,
I just had to remark that perhaps you were
wrong.”</p>

<p>“As how?” persisted Scotty, who always had
to be shown.</p>

<p>“How about Old Baldy?” Frank remarked,
quietly.</p>

<p>The Colonel uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“The boy may be right,” he remarked, with
some little excitement. “It never occurred to me
to remember that that smart old chap got out of<!-- 134.png -->
here some way; and just as like as not he couldn’t
get past that little opening, which was kept closed
most of the time, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“But he was brought in that way, an’ don’t it
stand to reason the critter’d try to get out by the
same route?” asked the foreman.</p>

<p>“I suppose he would try,” admitted the stockman;
“but finding the cork in the bottle, Old
Baldy might take a turn in another direction.
And that makes me think of something that happened
years ago, when the old fellow disappeared
one bad winter, and was gone with a few cows
for some months. We gave them up for dead;
when early in Spring they turned up on the range,
looking sleek and fat, as if they’d wintered where
there was plenty of grass. See the point, boys?”</p>

<p>“Well, well, I wouldn’t put it past that Old
Baldy to have found his way into this same fine
valley, and stayed here till the winter was gone,
with its Northers,” Frank declared, with exultation
in his voice; for such a happening would add
strength to his suggestion, strange as it had at first
appeared to the others.</p>

<p>“And if he happened to come in here and go
out through some other pass, that even the rustlers
never knew a thing about, doesn’t it stand to
reason that such a sharp steer would be able to
find the way again, even if years had passed?”
Colonel Haywood demanded.<!-- 135.png --></p>

<p>Bart looked at Scotty, nodded his head, and
observed:</p>

<p>“There never was such a critter as Old Baldy
before, and I reckon he’d easy remember that
trail. Course, though, it might be he went out
through the regular way, for it might ’a been open
at the time.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s look at that closer,” said Frank.
“When Bob and I first ran across Old Baldy
he was away off a direct line between the mouth
of the canyon and Circle Ranch. And, Bart, you
must admit, that once he came out of that pass,
he would hit a bee-line for home!”</p>

<p>The foreman threw up his hands.</p>

<p>“I pass,” he declared. “When it comes to arguing
I’m not in it with you, Frank.”</p>

<p>“But answer my question—wouldn’t Old Baldy
be apt to head straight for home?” insisted the
boy.</p>

<p>“Sure he would, every time,” admitted Bart.</p>

<p>“And that’s a strong point you’ve made, son,”
declared the stockman, with a proud glance at
Frank. “The chances are three to one Old
Baldy got out of this valley by some other trail
than the one we took in entering, and which has
just been blocked by the rustlers. Now, the question
comes, can we find that other exit, and make
use of it to take the herd out this same way?”</p>

<p>He had already sent a messenger back to the<!-- 136.png -->
camp to tell the two guards of the bunk-house
what had happened, so that they might not relax
their vigilance, and allow the prisoners a chance
to escape during broad daylight.</p>

<p>“And that same is going to tax us some, I
opine,” grumbled Bart.</p>

<p>“Not if we can only find the trail of Old
Baldy,” said Frank, cheerfully.</p>

<p>“His trail!” echoed Bob, in dismay, as he
looked down at the ground, which just at that
point had been torn up by scores of hoofs.
“Well, I should say that would be a tough old
job, just as Bart declared. How can you do it,
Frank?”</p>

<p>“Well, stop and think a minute,” replied the
other. “Don’t you remember my telling you
that Old Baldy has a marked hoof, one so much
longer than any other steers, that a tracker could
tell it anywhere at a glance?”</p>

<p>“Why, to be sure you did,” cried Bob; “and
I remember that we thought perhaps Scotty might
be able to follow his tracks back to where he came
from; because we believed even then he must have
been in the hands of Mendoza’s crowd, since his
brand had been burned over.”</p>

<p>“Just what we did,” Frank remarked; “but
before anything could be done Mendoza made his
raid on our prize herd, and that brought us here
on the jump. But if we could follow that marked<!-- 137.png -->
trail over the plain and up into the mountains,
why not do as well here in the valley?”</p>

<p>“Scotty, you hear that?” asked the stockman.</p>

<p>“You bet I do, an’ I’m going to get some busy
right off’n the handle. No use lookin’ away up
here, is there?” the cowboy observed.</p>

<p>“Well,” the rancher went on to say, “let’s take
it for granted that Old Baldy first tried to get out
the regular way, and finding the passage blocked
by rocks which a man might easily climb over,
but a steer never, he turned around sharp, and
put for that other exit, which he had never forgotten
in all these years. So, Scotty, take a turn
around, and see if you can run across that marked
hoof print.”</p>

<p>Frank was not the one to linger when anything
of this sort was going on. After all, he might
chance to find the track himself in the midst of
the multitude that scoured the side of the
valley.</p>

<p>“Head back toward the camp!” called out the
stockman; “and if either one finds the track, give
a call to the rest. We’ll keep close by.”</p>

<p>Bob himself could not help getting down every
little while to look at the torn turf, where scores
of hoofs had cut in, on the passage of cattle back
and forth. Each time he had to shake his head,
and smile.</p>

<p>“If it depended on me to run Old Baldy down,
I just reckon the herd would stay in here till
doomsday,” he admitted to the stockman.</p>

<p>“Well, of course, in most spots, the cattle coming
after must have crushed out all traces of Old
Baldy’s hoof-mark,” declared Colonel Haywood;
“but some place or other we hope that a single
print may have escaped. That’s all they need to
tell the story, you know.”</p>

<p>“And of course,” pursued Bob, wisely, “they
can easily settle which way the steer was going at
the time, because the mark will be pointing in that
direction.”</p>

<p>“Exactly, my boy. These things are all very
simple, once you get the cue. To a trailer everything
has its meaning. He reads signs as we do
print. And I’ve known Scotty there to spin a
yarn that made the rest of us think he was joshing,
without ever seeing the people ahead; and
yet when we came to prove it, everything was
just as he had described.”</p>

<p>“It’s a wonderful science, sir, and I hope to
master it some day; but seems to me I get on terribly
slow,” Bob said, dismally.</p>

<p>“Everything that is worth while takes time,”
remarked the stockman, encouragingly; “and
tracking can’t be learned in a week, a month, nor
yet in a year. Truth to tell, most cowboys never
do learn it worth while. It doesn’t run in the
blood, you see. They can rope steers, break<!-- 139.png -->
bucking broncos, and do all such things; but only
to a favored few does the trail give up all its wonderful
secrets.”</p>

<p>“I hope Frank gets sight of the tracks first,”
said Bob, as his eyes followed the stooping figure
of his chum longingly.</p>

<p>“That must be a matter of chance,” remarked
the other, smiling. “Frank is a pretty fair hand
at this business, but of course not in the same class
with Scotty. Still, he may be lucky enough to be
the one to run across the first track.”</p>

<p>“There he is, stooping down lower now, sir,”
exclaimed Bob, with some excitement in his voice;
“and he seems to be a heap interested in something.
Do you think he will make a strike,
sir?”</p>

<p>“He acts like it,” responded the stockman,
himself deeply concerned in the actions of his boy.
“See, there he turns back this way, and waves
his hand. And now he calls, to let Scotty know.
You can see him hurrying to Frank’s side; so it
looks as if he’d made some sort of find.”</p>

<p>Together the ranch owner and Bob hurried
forward, with Bart close at their heels. They
found the two trail hunters with their heads close
together, evidently examining some track, which
Frank had been fortunate enough to run across
at a point where the herd had failed to wipe it
out.<!-- 140.png --></p>

<p>“What luck, boys?” asked the stockman, as
he came up.</p>

<p>“Frank has found Old Baldy’s hoof-mark, all
right,” declared Scotty, without the faintest trace
of jealousy in his manner; for he was very fond
of his employer’s son, as indeed was every one
connected with Circle Ranch.</p>

<p>Bob himself pushed in, because he wanted to
satisfy his mind with regard to the direction in
which the hoofprint pointed.</p>

<p>He had noted the peculiar mark at that other
time, when Frank told him about it, and readily
recognized it now, plainly indented in the yielding
soil, at a spot where, luckily, none of the other
cattle had happened to tread, either in coming or
going.</p>

<p>And Bob laughed to see how easily that one
point was settled. The footprint undoubtedly
pointed toward the camp; and it was evident that
Old Baldy had been heading in that quarter when
the mark was impressed there!</p>
</div>

<div id='chXVI' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br/>THE ADVANCE DISPUTED</h2>

<p>“What next, Colonel?” asked Scotty, as he
arose from examining the print of Old Baldy’s
hoof.</p>

<p>“There’s only one thing to do,” replied the
stockman; “which is to head back in the direction
of the camp, watching out to see just where the
old rascal left the regular trail, and branched out
for himself. Once we get started on that, it
ought to be easy for you, Scotty.”</p>

<p>“I guess yes,” answered the squatty cowboy;
whose legs seemed to look very much like a loop,
partly on account of the sheepskin chaps he wore.</p>

<p>He took one side, while Frank looked after the
other. In this fashion, then, they all started toward
the camp down in the valley.</p>

<p>It was not a great while before Scotty emitted
a roar.</p>

<p>“Here she goes, sure as you’re born, and
a-headin’ out in great shape,” he declared, as the
others came up. “Oh! that Old Baldy never did
forget nothin’ he ever knowed; and here he goes,
a-headin’ up for that other outlet, just like he remembered
every foot of the way. Come along,
Colonel; it looks like we was a-goin’ to larn mor’n
Mendoza himself ever did; an’ all through a
pesky steer!”</p>

<p>The others were well content to drop in line
after the stunted trailer, who continued to move
along, with his eyes constantly watching the
ground. Frank and Bob came close in his rear;
while back of them were the stockman and his
overseer, both anxious to learn how the game
turned out.</p>

<p>“We’re heading up all the time, that’s one
thing sure,” remarked Bob, after they had been
pushing along in this fashion for some ten minutes,
at least.</p>

<p>“And you can see how wild it looks up here,”
Frank added. “Like as not Mendoza and his
men never thought it worth while to explore this
part of the ridge; for it wouldn’t strike them that
cattle could ever find a way of climbing over
such big piles of rocks. But Old Baldy has found
a means of going in and out, all right.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he knew where he was heading for
when he struck out up here, that’s a cinch,” declared
Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s right, he did,” Scotty announced, with
conviction. “That rascal wa’nt just runnin’ wild
when he headed this way. He had an object in<!-- 143.png -->
comin’, you mark me when I says it. And we’re
a-goin’ to know what that object was before a
great while now.”</p>

<p>“We’ve just got to,” laughed Frank, “because
we’ll soon be at the top of the old ridge, the way
we’re climbing. And dad, if it turns out that
Old Baldy shows us a new way out of the valley,
what are you going to do to him when we get
back home?”</p>

<p>“He can own the ranch,” replied the stockman,
readily. “He’ll be in clover for the rest of
his days, I promise you, son.”</p>

<p>The way grew more difficult; yet no matter
what obstacles seemed to loom up ahead, there
was always a way around them, and Old Baldy
knew the trail. Many times Bob lost all signs,
and would have been compelled to give up in
despair; but Frank pointed out where a stone had
been displaced, or it might be a twig ground under
the weight of the heavy steer.</p>

<p>“He climbs like a mountain goat, that Baldy!”
declared Bob, after an unusually hard effort, that
winded him more or less.</p>

<p>“Oh! all cattle can do that,” Frank assured
him. “Wait till you see the whole herd putting
up this steep slope; even the youngest will surprise
you by the way they hang on to the side of
the hill, and climb over all sorts of things that
give us more or less trouble.”</p>

<p>“One thing I notice,” remarked Bob.</p>

<p>“And what’s that?” asked his chum.</p>

<p>“We don’t get even an occasional peep in at
the camp. The big spur or shoulder of the mountain
that juts out hides it. And Frank, by the
same token, it would keep any one down there
from noticing Old Baldy, if he climbed this place
in the daytime.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Bob,” replied the other. “I
didn’t think of that myself. And perhaps the
rustlers never took the trouble to look around
to see if that pass was the only way in and out.
You know they’re a lazy lot, taken as a whole,
and hate to do the least thing except when in the
saddle.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Scotty, who heard the remark,
“they’s a lot o’ cow punchers in that same
class, don’t you forget it, Frank. In the saddle
they kin ride, and cavort around hours an’ hours.
Drop ’em on their feet, an’ they act like ducks on
dry land. A cowboy has no business afoot when
he kin git a pony under him.”</p>

<p>Scotty came to a halt a little further on. He
seemed to be interested in something ahead.</p>

<p>“Wow!” he exclaimed, “it sure is a Mountain
Charley squattin’ there. Reckon we might be
a-goin’ to have a little trouble along of him sooner
or later, when the cattle get to comin’ up this
way.”</p>

<p>Bob instantly understood, for he recognized
the name as one given to a grizzly bear in California,
and among some of the cowboys of the
Southwest.</p>

<p>“Where is he?” he asked. “Frank, we’ve
got our guns; and perhaps we’ll just have to
touch up the old fellow; because it would never
do to let him get among the stock.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the ranchman, immediately; “for
while he might content himself with just a single
cow, the sight and smell of him would surely
stampede the rest of the herd; and let that once
happen up here, and we’d never get them together
again.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have to try and bowl him over,
Bob,” said Frank, as he looked to his repeating
rifle, which was one of the very best on the
market.</p>

<p>Bob felt the sportsman blood leap in his veins.
This was different from shooting an innocent little
antelope, which he never did without feeling more
or less sorry; and only repeated the exploit because
fresh food was needed. But a grizzly bear
was a foe worthy of the efforts of the most experienced
hunter.</p>

<p>Bob had had one experience in this line, and
not a great distance away from the spot where
he now stood; for it had been on the occasion
of their first visit to Thunder Mountain that it<!-- 146.png -->
happened, and in the entrance to the big canyon
leading upward.</p>

<p>He could see the bear, now that Scotty had
pointed him out. The animal was apparently
aware of the presence of human beings; but he
showed not the slightest trace of fear, or a desire
to retreat.</p>

<p>“He seems to be right on the trail,” declared
Frank, as he looked.</p>

<p>“That’s just what he is,” Scotty added; “and
I reckon now that p’raps he was startin’ to foller
the tracks of Old Baldy, if there was the least
whiff of scent left for him to get. Then he
heard us a-comin’, and squats down to see who
we is, an’ what we wants in his diggings.”</p>

<p>They continued to advance. Colonel Haywood,
Bart and Scotty had all drawn their revolvers,
and were ready to give a good account of
themselves should the conflict be brought to close
quarters. All of them knew how very tough a
grizzly bear is, and that often many bullets will
fail to bring such a terrible brute down.</p>

<p>“No use shootin’ till we get some closer, boys,”
said Scotty.</p>

<p>“There, see, he’s getting up now!” exclaimed
Bob. “Perhaps he means to challenge us to a
fight; or, not liking the looks of our crowd, expects
to walk off to his den, which must be up
here somewheres.”</p>

<p>“Never knowed one to back out of a scrap,”
avowed Scotty.</p>

<p>“He’s coming at us now, on all fours, and
looking as if he meant to take us on in a bunch.
Don’t you think we ought to let him have a shot,
Frank?” Bob asked, a trifle nervously; for he
had been appalled upon examining that other
grizzly to note the terrible claws, and the enormous
muscular power of the animal’s legs.</p>

<p>“Not yet, Bob,” Frank answered, coolly;
“hold your horses, and pretty soon we’ll have
our chance. Don’t forget to try and get him
back of the shoulder, if you can, or in the eye.
Either the brain or the heart is the place to hit
a grizzly; you can pump him full of lead in other
places, and he’ll walk off with it, so they say.”</p>

<p>No doubt the calm manner in which Frank
handled his rifle did much to reassure the less
experienced Bob. He immediately “took a
brace,” and quieted his nerves, well knowing that
unless he secured the mastery over himself he
could hardly do good work when the moment
came to fire.</p>

<p>As both parties were now approaching each
other, the crisis could not long be delayed. Bob
thought his chum might be going a little too far.
Still, he remembered that at the famous battle of
Bunker Hill, General Putnam had ordered the
waiting line of Continentals to hold their fire until<!-- 148.png -->
they could see the whites of the enemy’s eyes. So
it was apparently good policy not to show too
much haste when expecting an attack.</p>

<p>“Get ready, Bob,” said Frank, presently, in a
low tone.</p>

<p>The grizzly was a little above them, and heading
straight toward the place where the five intruders
into his domain were huddled together.
He meant to attack them all without the least
hesitation. This, Scotty afterwards declared,
was something unusual for a grizzly to do, except
when half starved. He might not make a move
to run away; but he does not often attack unless
wounded and enraged.</p>

<p>“But, Frank, he’s heading so straight this way,
that I just can’t find a chance to aim behind his
shoulder as you said,” Bob complained. “Shall
I try to get him in one of his little eyes?”</p>

<p>“Wait just three seconds; he’s got to turn
around that rock, you notice. As he comes out
again he’ll be broadside on, above us. Be ready
to give him your first shot as I say the word.
Quick! now, look sharp!”</p>

<p>Even while Frank was saying this the bear did
indeed pass back of the spur of rock, just as the
boy had foreseen. Bob let his cheek rest against
the stock of his rifle. He was covering the exact
spot where he expected the grizzly to show up in
another second.<!-- 149.png --></p>

<p>As his nose came into view, he waddled forward,
as bold as any lion ever could be, and, some
hunters claim, a great deal more so.</p>

<p>“Now!”</p>

<p>Frank uttered this one word. It was immediately
drowned in a double crash, as both guns
were discharged. With the sound arose a series
of cowboy yells from Bart and Scotty, who had
been awaiting the result of the volley with more
or less suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>Bob mechanically went through the pump action
which sent the discharged shell flying out to
one side, and pushed a fresh cartridge into the
firing chamber; at the same time leaving the gun
ready for business, with the hammer raised.</p>

<p>He looked upward, and was thrilled to see the
great hairy figure of the grizzly apparently rushing
straight down toward them. Naturally the
first and dominating thought that possessed the
mind of the Kentucky lad was that, after all, their
lead had failed to reach a fatal spot; and that the
bear was now bent on seeking revenge for the
pain inflicted on him. Those yells which Bob had
at first believed to stand for exultation, might
after all mean the demoralization of the cowboys
because of this rush of the great beast!</p>
</div>

<div id='chXVII' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br/>OVER THUNDER MOUNTAIN RIDGE</h2>

<p>“Look out, Frank, he’s coming after us!”</p>

<p>Bob was trying vainly to get a decent aim as he
shouted these words of warning. He had spoken
them in a mechanical way, and not because he
feared that his chum would not be on his guard.</p>

<p>Already were Bart and Scotty popping away
with their guns, after the fashion of cowboys,
quick on the trigger. Then Bob suddenly
noticed a queer thing. This was nothing more
or less than that the grizzly, while still coming
down the side of the mountain, and headed directly
for the spot where they stood, seemed to
have swerved more or less. In fact he was coming
down tail foremost!</p>

<p>It was this singular fact that gave Bob his first
suspicion of the truth. Then, quick on the heels
of this he discovered that Frank was acting in a
most peculiar fashion for a boy who ought to be
greatly concerned because a ferocious beast was
about to attack them.</p>

<p>Frank seemed to double up like a hinge, and to<!-- 151.png -->
the amazement of Bob he saw that the other
was laughing!</p>

<p>“Hold on, boys!” Frank managed to call out;
“don’t waste your ammunition, because you may
need it. That bear is dead!”</p>

<p>Of course, upon hearing this surprising and
agreeable news, both Bart and Scotty stopped
shooting.</p>

<p>“Did they kill him, or was it our first bullets
that did the trick, Frank?” Bob asked, as the
body of the monster became wedged against an
uplifted spur of rock not ten feet away.</p>

<p>“We don’t take the credit, you understand,”
announced Bart, positively, and with a rather
foolish grin at the recent panic he and Scotty had
indulged in.</p>

<p>“I reckon we don’t need to,” remarked the
other cowboy, energetically. “These here pop-guns
don’t count much agin a grizzly. An’ when
ye come to look the critter over, I allow ye’ll find
whar ye punctured his hide right back o’ the foreleg,
both bullets enterin’ thar.”</p>

<p>It proved to be a fact, upon examination; and
Bob felt particularly well satisfied to know that in
such an emergency he had managed to acquit
himself so well. Such results seemed to show
that his nerve was all right.</p>

<p>“But we can’t let the old fellow lie here,” said
Frank.<!-- 152.png --></p>

<p>Bob looked surprised at this.</p>

<p>“Why, what harm can a dead bear do?” he
asked. “I should think that all the fight had
gone out of him by now.”</p>

<p>“Sure it has,” answered his chum; “but you’d
never get that skittish herd past this spot, let me
tell you. They would scent that bear fifty feet
away. Dead or alive, it wouldn’t make much difference
to them, and we’d be apt to have a
stampede on our hands. How about that,
Bart?”</p>

<p>“A dead certainty, Frank,” replied the foreman.</p>

<p>“Then how would it do to roll him over that
precipice there?” suggested Bob. “I’m sorry
we can’t get his hide; but it will have to go this
time.”</p>

<p>“Just the idea,” declared Frank; “and it was
smart of you to think of it, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Then all come, and take hold, while we
yank him around. It’ll take the united strength
of the bunch to slew him out of that crotch,”
said Bart, leading the way to the slain animal.</p>

<p>At any rate, the two boys were allowed to see
just where their lead had gone.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t ’a been better shots; no sir, not if
it was the oldest b’ar hunter of the Rockies!” declared
Scotty, as he thrust a finger in the holes
and turned a look of genuine admiration on both
Frank and his chum.</p>

<p>Bob thought that praise was the limit. The
memory of that exciting little event would follow
him always. In imagination he would many
times see that grizzly heading down the slope,
bent on questioning their right to progress along
the mountain trail; and the quick action which he
and Frank had been compelled to take in order to
meet the crisis.</p>

<p>“All together now, yo-heave-o! Here she
goes, boys! Once more, and yet another for
good luck. Now, over with the old critter, ker-slam!”
and as Scotty spoke he led the last effort,
by means of which the bulk was pushed over the
edge of the little precipice.</p>

<p>There was a heavy thud as the bear brought
up far below.</p>

<p>Once more they could start out. The affair
with the bear had occupied only a few minutes, all
told.</p>

<p>Scotty again took up the tracking of the marked
hoof belonging to Old Baldy. The trail still ran
upwards toward the crest of the ridge, and there
no longer remained a single doubt in the minds
of the two boys but that the clever old steer had
made his final escape from the secret valley in
this way.</p>

<p>They even began to cast their eyes aloft in the
hope and expectation that soon they might figure<!-- 154.png -->
on just where the break in the rocky wall was to
be found, with a passage leading over to the
other side of the ridge.</p>

<p>“I think I see where we’re bound to bring up,”
Frank presently remarked.</p>

<p>“Then show me, please,” said Bob, eagerly,
for his eyes, being unaccustomed to the looks of
wild places, had not up to then been able to accomplish
much.</p>

<p>“Seems to me there is some sort of break just
between those two spurs that stand up yonder like
sentries,” Frank declared.</p>

<p>“You’re correct, Frank!” cried Scotty; “I
been watchin’ that same spot myself for a while,
now, and was just a-goin’ to mention it. That’s
whar she lies, Colonel, believe me! Frank’s got
the eyes of a hawk, I do declare. ’Tain’t much
escapes him, now.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll get up there in a few minutes,
won’t we?” demanded Bob.</p>

<p>“Easy,” affirmed Bart. “And I say just the
same as the others. That’s the place our old
steer quit the valley, when he yearned to git back
home, and broke out of the wire corral. Now
you can see it plain, Bob.”</p>

<p>Indeed, as they progressed further it became
a positive thing; even Bob was able to note the
fact that there was some sort of little pass between
those two rocky horns.</p>

<p>And so they found it shortly afterwards, when<!-- 155.png -->
they entered the small canyon, to pass quickly
through, and see how the trail started down the
other side of the mountain.</p>

<p>“That settles it!” cried Colonel Haywood,
showing that the strain had eased up considerably
in his mind. “We’ll be able to push the herd
over here. Trust some of the old steers for
knowing that Baldy went ahead of them. And
there’s hope, boys, of our being down there on
the plain long before dark sets in.”</p>

<p>They turned back at once, and made all possible
haste to arrive at the spot where their comrades
were watching the cattle.</p>

<p>“Everything seems to be all right down there,”
remarked the stockman, when at one point they
managed to obtain a glimpse of the huddled herd,
with the cowboys on foot circling constantly
around, in order to make sure that no start was
made toward a stampede.</p>

<p>“Hark! what does that mean?” cried Bob, as
shots sounded in the valley.</p>

<p>“Somethin’ doin’ down by the camp, I reckon,”
asserted Scotty. “P’raps Mendoza is a-tryin’
to break out, and the boys are givin’ the rustlers
‘Hail Columbia.’”</p>

<p>After the few shots all was quiet again, a fact
that seemed to satisfy the rancher that nothing
serious had come of the effort.</p>

<p>“I reckon they saw some sign of a break, and<!-- 156.png -->
just sent in a few shots to sort of remind the
rustlers that they were still thar on the job,” Bart
suggested; but not being able to learn the facts
they had to let that theory stand.</p>

<p>Arriving at the place where the big herd
awaited their coming, they were soon busily employed
getting the stock started. This was no
easy task, there on the mountainside, with only a
dim trail ahead.</p>

<p>But these men were old hands at the business.
They knew all the tricks of the trade, and how to
utilize the instincts of the cattle in carrying out
their designs.</p>

<p>Once the herd started upward, they seemed to
begin to understand. One of the big steers led
the way, doubtless occupying much the same position
that Old Baldy had been accustomed to filling.
Possibly the animal could catch the scent
of the preceding beast; though even Bob considered
this somewhat unlikely, since so much
time had elapsed since Baldy passed over the
ground.</p>

<p>But in climbing upward the latter had always
unerringly chosen what seemed to be the only
possible route; so once the herd started, it could
not easily go wrong.</p>

<p>Colonel Haywood had sent a messenger down
to the camp with new word for those two daring
cowboys who were shouldering the difficult task<!-- 157.png -->
of keeping the rustlers penned up during the
whole day.</p>

<p>They were to wait for night, and then slip secretly
away. Their horses would be left in a
certain place for them, and they were ordered to
follow the broad trail of the herd until they overtook
the main body of drivers.</p>

<p>Up the mountain the drive continued. Constant
vigilance was required in order to keep the
herd intact. Any little break might prove a serious
matter, with that precipitous slope below
them, down which a frightened animal would
plunge to what must surely prove to be a fatal
conclusion.</p>

<p>“I’ve been through some drives in my time,”
Bart remarked, after they had pushed along in
this way for nearly two hours, and the crest of
the ridge was close at hand, “but this sure takes
the cake. If we get this herd safe down to level
land again I’ll be mighty glad, I’m tellin’ ye, now.”</p>

<p>Bob was himself well pleased when the last of
the steers had passed through the little canyon,
and started down the outer slope.</p>

<p>The going here was better, somehow, as they
all realized before they had been ten minutes following
the stock downward. Undoubtedly this
was the trail Old Baldy must have struck at the
time he and several cows were missing all winter.
Following some instinct, he had thus discovered<!-- 158.png -->
a way into a Paradise of a valley, where the forage
was fine through all the winter months.</p>

<p>“The only thing that surprises me,” remarked
Frank, later, when speaking of the matter, “is
that Baldy never tried the same game again when
winter came along. But perhaps there were reasons.
He may have been shut in a corral at the
time. Once I remember he was suffering from a
sore leg, on account of tearing through a barbed
wire fence. But things are looking all right, dad,
I should say.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be better, son,” replied the stockman,
smilingly; “and all we need now to make
us happy is to feel our ponies under us.”</p>

<p>At those words every cowboy within hearing
set up a shout. The very mention of a bronco
acted on them as might a tonic. This business
of climbing mountains on foot, and driving a herd
the same way, was the most trying experience possible.
It would haunt them for many a long day;
and a mere mention of the trip over Thunder
Mountain ridge from the Lost Valley would be
enough to make them content with their lot, no
matter what troubles they happened to be facing
at the time.</p>

<p>Foreseeing that they would be slow about getting
to the foot of the descent, the stockman had
sent a couple of men ahead to scurry around to
where they had left all their mounts.<!-- 159.png --></p>

<p>If these could be waiting for them when they
struck the level, it would save considerable time,
and add much to their comfort.</p>

<p>There were little accidents, to be sure, on the
way down; but all things considered they did remarkably
well. But it was certainly a used-up
bunch of cowboys that, an hour or so before dusk,
gave a screech as they found themselves on the
level once more, with no more climbing or descending
mountains ahead.</p>

<p>“Never want to see a mountain again!” declared
Scotty, as he limped along, his feet sore,
and his lower limbs feeling as though they had
been scorched.</p>

<p>“But look there, isn’t that Jeff coming with
the ponies?” asked Frank, pointing.</p>

<p>It turned out to be so; and from that moment
every driver quite forgot all his aches in the wild
desire to once more mount, and experience the
delight of being carried swiftly from place to
place. Walking to a cowboy is a waste of time
and energy. And the saddle boys were also glad
to get their favorites again.<!-- 160.png --></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br/>DRIVING THE HERD</h2>

<p>At noon the drivers had eaten whatever they
chanced to have along with them. If one happened
to be better provided than his mates, he
was only too willing to share his lunch. It was
anticipated that when night came one of the
yearlings in the herd would be sacrificed to make
a supper for the outfit; and on the strength of
this the boys had been enabled to put in the entire
afternoon.</p>

<p>Once they “threw a leg over a saddle” they
seemed to revive wonderfully. After that the
tired herd would have to hasten to keep up, for
the horses were fresh.</p>

<p>But Colonel Haywood knew they could not expect
to make any great distance before camping.
He saw that some of the cattle were footsore, and
liable to drop if pushed too far.</p>

<p>“There’s only one thing we’ve got to look out
for,” remarked Bart, as they considered the advisability
of stopping for the night.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Bob, who chanced to
be alongside the foreman at the time.<!-- 161.png --></p>

<p>“We don’t have any way of knowing what
them rustlers might feel like doing, once they git
out of that bunk-house,” Bart continued.</p>

<p>“Do you mean they may take a notion to follow us,
and fight for the possession of the herd?”
asked the boy, thrilled by the possibility of further
adventure on this trip.</p>

<p>“Well, as a rule, the fellers that foller that
line of business are a lot of cowardly coyotes;
and on bein’ found out will run to beat the band,”
Bart went on. “But this here Mendoza, he’s
hard to place. Course he’s just boilin’ over mad
because his fine hiding place is discovered, and
he’ll never be able to use the same again. Question
is, will he make a break for the border, thinking
the ranchers are hot on his trail; or foller
after us, just for spite, to stampede the herd, and
make trouble?”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have to keep a pretty good watch,
I should think,” Bob observed.</p>

<p>“That goes without sayin’, younker,” replied
the boss puncher. “And as some of the stock
just look all in, we’ll have to call a halt here and
now. It’s as good a place as we can find, I
opine.”</p>

<p>“Just what I was going to say, Bart,” laughed
Frank, coming up at that moment; “for the grass
is good, considering the season; and here’s all the
water wanted, fresh from the mountains.”</p>

<p>When the shouts of the cowboys told the weary
cattle that they were to stop and rest, they gave
evidence of their satisfaction. Crowding along
the little stream, they drank their fill after the
heat of the day. Some began to crop the forage,
with others immediately dropped down, utterly
exhausted by their labors.</p>

<p>With the report of a gun one of the yearlings
dropped, and a cowboy was soon busily engaged
in cutting the animal up to serve as their supper.</p>

<p>A fire was started, though fuel seemed scarce.
But then, only a cooking blaze was required, and
after supper was served they would have no further
need for any fire.</p>

<p>Bob admitted frankly that he felt tired out,
though he did not fully realize just how weary
he was until he had sat down a little while, and
then attempted to rise suddenly.</p>

<p>“Why, I just can’t do it, Frank!” he exclaimed
with a long face. “Seems as if my legs needed
oiling about the hinges, they’re that rusty. Gee!
I hope I’ll be feeling better than this in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t worry about that,” laughed his
chum, who, of course, being somewhat tougher,
had not suffered quite as much as Bob; “after a
sleep you’ll be as fresh as a daisy again.”</p>

<p>“But I want to stand my watch to-night, all the
same,” ventured Bob, positively.<!-- 163.png --></p>

<p>Frank looked at him.</p>

<p>“What’s come over you, to say that?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Because, when there’s danger around I think
every fellow ought to share the duties of standing
guard,” Bob replied, sturdily.</p>

<p>At that Frank whistled, and then chuckled.</p>

<p>“I see you’ve been talking with Bart, and he’s
given you the idea the rustlers may be silly enough
to follow after us, just to get revenge,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Well, Bart did say something like that,” Bob
admitted; “and he also told me he meant to keep
a close watch all night, to prevent a surprise and
a stampede.”</p>

<p>“Oh! rats! don’t you believe there’s anything
like that going to happen,” Frank hastened to remark,
seeing that his chum was really concerned
and worried over the grim predictions of the boss
cowboy.</p>

<p>“Then you don’t take any stock in it, yourself,
Frank?”</p>

<p>“No I don’t,” replied the other, quickly adding:
“though of course Bart is quite right in saying
he doesn’t mean to take any chances of a
stampede in the night. We’ve done so well that
it would be a shame to have any accident happen
now.”</p>

<p>“But how about the rustlers?” asked the
other.<!-- 164.png --></p>

<p>“Well, by this time they’re out of that bunk-house,
perhaps; or will be as soon as it’s really
dark. My opinion is, if you want to hear it,
Bob, that they’ll get out of that valley on foot as
fast as they can, leaving their ponies behind them,
because they won’t know about this other gateway,
you understand.”</p>

<p>“And then?” continued Bob.</p>

<p>“They’ll be in a panic, believing that, since
they’re known now, the country’ll soon be too hot
to hold ’em. And so there’ll be a chase for the
Mexican border; and a ‘good riddance to bad
rubbish’ for Arizona,” Frank concluded.</p>

<p>After that little talk Bob’s fears subsided somewhat,
though he did occasionally cast a furtive
glance backward to where the high rocky ridge
cut across the sky-line, as though wondering what
was taking place beyond the barrier.</p>

<p>Supper was soon ready, and it was an almost
famished bunch of cow punchers who gathered
around, taking turns at eating; for Bart would
not let the herd go unguarded even for a minute.</p>

<p>Arrangements were soon made looking to a detail
of wranglers to stand watch over the saddle
horses and the cattle. Bob was not allowed any
share in this duty, much to his regret, for he was
in earnest in his wish to have a part in the labor.
His inexperience would have rendered his work
of little value, and the head herder decided that
he might just as well get his full rest.<!-- 165.png --></p>

<p>Bob lay down the best he could. He needed
no lullaby to put him to sleep that night. The
last things he remembered hearing were the whispers
of the boys who sat near by, the drone of insects
in the grass, the uneasy movements of the
herd not far away, and some night bird calling in
the trees close by the foot of the mountains.</p>

<p>When he awoke he could hardly believe his
senses, as he sat up and dug his knuckles in his
eyes. It was getting broad daylight. The cattle
seemed to be for the most part feeding on the
sweet grass that grew close to the creek; and were
apparently in good trim for the long drive to the
ranch.</p>

<p>“Well, that was a time when I slept like a top,
sure pop,” said Bob, as he started to get to his
feet. “Seems as if I’d just lain down; and yet
here it is dawn. And nothing happened after
all!”</p>

<p>There was a shade of disappointment in Bob’s
tone. Whether this came from the fact that he
had not been allowed to share in guarding the
camp, because of his being reckoned a greenhorn;
or on account of the failure of Bart’s prediction
of further trouble, it would be hard to say.</p>

<p>Enough of the beef remained to serve for
breakfast; and they hoped to be at the ranch
before they were hungry again.</p>

<p>“You see, we didn’t have any trouble after all,
Bob,” said Frank, as he joined his chum, who was
looking after his horse at the time.</p>

<p>“If we did, I must have slept right through it
all,” chuckled Bob. “Never knew a thing from
the time I shut my eyes till daylight wakened me.
But I reckon nothing bothered the herd, and
we’re starting the day fine.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe even a stray wolf or coyote
came near, the whole night,” Frank went on. “I
was up myself for two hours, keeping watch over
the cattle; and once I thought I heard the report
of firearms, but it wasn’t repeated; and right now
I couldn’t say what it was I caught. Might have
been just one of those little rock slides up on the
mountain.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad it’s all over,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Same here,” Frank added. “It’s sure been
some strenuous. And that climb over the ridge
was the toughest ever. I suppose you’ll believe
now what I told you about how cattle can get up,
and go some?”</p>

<p>“They’re just great at climbing, that’s what,”
the other admitted.</p>

<p>After breakfast the start was made. There
was little trouble with the herd now. Reaching
level land had apparently brought about a return
of their confidence; and it might even be that some
of the older steers could scent their customary
feeding grounds in the distance.<!-- 167.png --></p>

<p>At any rate they started off, and being once
more in their glory while mounted on their ponies,
the cowboys proved as active as cats, darting here
and there to keep their charges in a compact mass
as they headed toward distant Circle Ranch.</p>

<p>It was about two hours later that Bob rode
alongside his chum.</p>

<p>“Say, do you suppose that means any trouble
for us, Frank?” he demanded; and as the other
turned his head to see what the Kentucky boy
might be pointing at, he discovered two horsemen
heading after them.</p>

<p>Visions of a desperate and vengeful Mendoza
had naturally leaped into Bob’s mind, at first seeing
these parties. Frank quickly put him at his
ease.</p>

<p>“Not by a jugfull, Bob,” he said, cheerfully.
“Those fellows are the two men we left behind
us in the valley, to guard the rustlers, and keep
them quiet. They got out all right, it seems, and
found their ponies where they were left.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they’ll be able to tell us something
about the rustlers, and what they were doing the
last they saw of the crowd?” Bob suggested.</p>

<p>“Well, as like as not they may,” his chum admitted;
and then they waited for the two riders
to overtake the herd drivers.</p>

<p>Of course there was considerable yelling and
waving of hats to mark the arrival of the balance<!-- 168.png -->
of the Circle Ranch outfit. But, knowing that
they should make their report to their employer
first, the two riders sought the spot where he and
the foreman were to be found.</p>

<p>Of course the two saddle boys hovered around,
wishing to learn any news in connection with
what had occurred in the valley during the preceding
day, while the great herd was being driven
over the ridge.</p>

<p>Under the skillful questioning of the stockman
the cowboys told their story. All through the
long day they had kept watch and ward over the
bunk-house. Several times the rustlers who were
being held prisoners there made a show of rushing
out; but they really lacked the nerve to take their
lives in their hands. And so evening still found
the situation unchanged.</p>

<p>When it was dark the two cowboys had fired a
few shots to let the rustlers understand they were
still on deck. Then they had decamped, and,
finding the exit, managed, after great difficulties,
to climb out over the masses of piled-up rock,
which had been torn loose by the explosion of
dynamite.</p>

<p>They had spent the balance of the night in
hiding, and when morning came made a “bee-line”
for the place where they had been informed
their horses would be waiting. After that it was
no great effort to discover the presence of the<!-- 169.png -->
herd off on the plain, and make direct for the
cattle.</p>

<p>“Then you saw nothing of the rustlers after
you left?” asked the stockman.</p>

<p>“We think we saw a bunch of riders far away
to the south, an hour back,” one of the cowboys
answered; “and hitting it up for all they were
worth. If so be the rustlers had a saddle band
outside the valley somewhere, then that must ’a
been the crowd we saw. No danger of them
comin’ back again.”</p>

<p>“Well, on the whole, it’s just as well,” remarked
Colonel Haywood; “though there are
those who have suffered at the hands of Mendoza
in the past who would much rather see him a
prisoner, and sent to the penitentiary for a long
term.”</p>

<p>“I reckon he’d never get thar,” remarked
Bart, with a smile and a nod, that Bob, though a
greenhorn, could easily interpret to mean that the
cow men knew of a better way to settle the rustler
so he could never again raid their herds.<!-- 170.png --></p>
</div>

<div id='chXIX' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br/>STARTLING NEWS</h2>

<p>“It promises to be a bully day for the round-up,
Frank!” remarked Bob, just forty-eight
hours after the morning that saw them near the
foot of the Thunder Mountain Ridge, and driving
the recovered herd homeward, after rescuing
it from the cattle rustlers of the dreaded
Mendoza.</p>

<p>“Just what it does,” replied his chum, who
was sitting on his buckskin pony, and looking out
to where a band of punchers were circling around
the first bunch of cattle that would require attention.</p>

<p>Colonel Haywood had been hearing from the
neighboring ranches ever since they reached
home. In a side corral he had all the cattle taken
from the rustlers, outside of those which he
recognized as his own property. Here the other
stockmen tried to pick out certain steers and cows
which had been stolen from them recently.</p>

<p>The original brands had been destroyed, and
a new one burned on the flanks of the animals.
Evidently these steers had been intended for shipping
at the first favorable opportunity for reaching
the railroad, on the part of the rustlers.</p>

<p>By degrees two-thirds of the recovered stock
had been claimed. The balance was likely to remain
in the hands of the Circle Ranch people,
since there was no means of identifying it.</p>

<p>Having made all his arrangements for the Fall
round-up, Colonel Haywood did not allow such
a little matter as his encounter with the rustler
band to disturb his well laid plans.</p>

<p>So this fine morning every cowboy employed on
the ranch, as well as some borrowed from friendly
neighbors, such as the Arrowhead over on the
creek, were hard at work, bringing in cattle to be
looked over, the brands renewed in cases where
they had become unsightly; and the youngsters
that had grown to a considerable size taken in
hand for the first time, and marked with the big
circle.</p>

<p>Since a full day had elapsed after their arrival
in safety at the ranch, the two saddle boys
had fully recovered from their fatigue. A couple
of good nights’ sleep had also done much toward
making them feel as “chipper as ever,” as Bob
expressed it.</p>

<p>“Will they get it all through with in one day?”
asked the Kentucky boy, laughing at the antics of
some of the wild riders who were rushing back<!-- 172.png -->
and forth on all sides of the herd, and showing
their wonderful skill in the saddle.</p>

<p>There were riders in the Circle outfit who had
few equals, when it came to carrying out the
many difficult feats whereby cowboys delight to
prove their claim to being better riders than even
the famous Russian Cossacks. They could do the
most astonishing tricks while galloping at full
speed over the plain. And Bob, though brought
up in an atmosphere where fine horses were bred,
the Blue Grass region of Kentucky, despaired of
ever equalling the records of some of these expert
and reckless punchers.</p>

<p>“Dad says it will take all of two, and maybe
more,” replied Frank. “You see, some of the
herds are a long ways off. And then you’d never
imagine the trouble an old steer gives, once in a
while, when it’s necessary to renew his brand.
I’ve seen half a dozen boys at their wits’ ends to
down a tough old chap; though they always get
him, sooner or later. But it takes time.”</p>

<p>“Old Baldy is with that lot, Frank; I’m sure
I can tell him from here, leading them all, like a
proud general.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s Baldy, sure. And no need of him
worrying about his feed after this. Every cowboy
on the range is proud of the way that old
rascal found his way out of the Lost Valley.
Why, just think how much we owe him. Only for<!-- 173.png -->
his leaving a marked trail up to the second gateway
we’d still have part of our herd cooped up
there, and a big job to dig a passage through
those tumble-down rocks to get ’em out.”</p>

<p>“Say, Frank, what do you think? I dreamed
last night that I found it!”</p>

<p>“I suppose now you’re talking of that wonderful
hunting knife you lost nearly a week back?”
remarked the other, smiling.</p>

<p>“Just that,” Bob went on.</p>

<p>“And where was it, in your dream?” continued
Frank.</p>

<p>“Where do you suppose, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you’re going to get me guessing, the
first place I’d think about would be the spot
where you cut up that deer, under the twin
cotton-woods. How is that for a starter,
Bob?”</p>

<p>“You made a bulls-eye of it that time, because
that’s just where I thought I found the old
blade!” Bob exclaimed.</p>

<p>“H’m, lying on the ground, and perhaps half
hidden under the grass or trash, eh?” his chum
continued.</p>

<p>“That’s where you missed fire. Where else but
sticking in the trunk of that tree, just where the
first crotch lies. But Frank, try as I will, I just
can’t remember ever putting it there.”</p>

<p>“Which doesn’t prove anything,” his chum<!-- 174.png -->
went on to say with decision. “Sometimes, you
know, we do things mechanically, and without
thinking.”</p>

<p>“Yes, just as a fellow will work his pump-gun,
after firing a round. It may be so, Frank. And
if it wasn’t that I want to see everything that goes
on at the grand round-up here, I’d ask you to
ride with me over the plain to where we got that
deer.”</p>

<p>“Well, I would have to decline, all the same,
Bob; because I’m wanted here, and so are you.
Another time will have to do. If it’s true that
the knife is there, I reckon it won’t run away
inside of another couple of days or so.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” replied Bob, a little dejectedly
it is true; for the longer the missing article eluded
his search the greater grew his desire to find it
again.</p>

<p>They were soon in the thick of the work.
Frank was given opportunities to show how he
could throw the rope, and bring a steer down.
Bob, too, took a chance; and as he had been practicing
diligently since his last public attempt, he
“did himself proud,” as he expressed it; actually
roping a big steer, and throwing the beast in a
way that brought out a round of cheers from
Frank and the boys.</p>

<p>Then Bob also assisted with the branding. The
afternoon found them still at it. With hundreds<!-- 175.png -->
of cattle to be looked over, considerable time was
required to accomplish a clean sweep.</p>

<p>Colonel Haywood found much cause for satisfaction.
His herds had increased even more than
his best record; and doubtless the next few shipments
would be banner ones for Circle Ranch.</p>

<p>Then again, the fact that he had not only recovered
his missing herd, but driven the rustlers
out of their long secret lair, was another cause
for congratulation.</p>

<p>On the preceding day a couple of cowboys had
been sent back over the trail, with instructions
to leave their horses at the foot of the mountain
ridge, and on foot follow the tracks left by the
escaping herd, passing into the valley by way
of the new gateway.</p>

<p>They were to look there for the horses of the
rustlers, which it was believed must have been
abandoned at the time of their flight; and should
these be found they would become the property
of Circle Ranch as spoils of war.</p>

<p>The afternoon was fairly well along when the
two saddle boys, being tired of the sights and
sounds marking the grand round-up, decided to
gallop a few miles away over the plain.</p>

<p>“There’s a lone pilgrim heading this way,
Frank; and he’s on foot too, which I take it is
some queer out in this country,” Bob remarked,
pointing as he spoke.<!-- 176.png --></p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t know,” his comrade said, “because
sometimes Indians don’t all happen to be
riders like the Apaches and Comanches, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Is that an Indian, then?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“It sure is, or my eyes deceive me,” Frank
went on; “and what’s more, perhaps we happen
to know him, too.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean Havasupai, the old Moqui,
Frank?”</p>

<p>“That man walks like him,” the prairie boy
continued; “and see, he’s making gestures to us
right now. I guess he’s recognized us all right.
Trust an Indian’s eyes for knowing a friend as
far as he can see him.”</p>

<p>“But the last we saw of Havasupai was up
there in the valley, when he shut the door of the
rustlers’ bunk-house, just when he knew every
man-jack of ’em was asleep! To tell the honest
truth, I had clean forgot all about the old fellow
after that.”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t forget him,” Frank remarked;
“but he never showed up again, and I had to
come away without seeing him. I reckoned he
didn’t want Mendoza to know he had played him
false. You see, the old Moqui was awfully anxious
to learn where his daughter, the Antelope,
was. It seems that the rustler married the Moqui
girl, and has her hidden away somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard him say she was down in
Mexico,” Bob declared. “It struck me that
Havasupai must imagine the girl is being badly
treated, and he wants to recover her again. Do
you think I’m near the truth there, Frank?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do,” answered the other, as he
swung around, and started his horse on an easy
lope toward the on coming figure.</p>

<p>Already Bob saw that it was certainly the old
Moqui. They had met Havasupai first of all up
in the region of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado,
as has been mentioned in an earlier volume
of this series. And his actions in the Lost Valley
had proven beyond all question that the Moqui
wished to retain their friendship.</p>

<p>“Dad will be glad to see him,” Frank remarked,
as they drew rapidly nearer the figure
of the weary walker. “He said he meant to help
the old man recover his child, if it was possible.
And I heard him even asking several of those
other stockmen if they knew anything about
Antelope.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I hope he came across a clue, then,”
Bob remarked; “because it must be hard on the
old chap, being exiled from his village, and losing
his only child.”</p>

<p>“Dad says that the old warrior can stay around
Circle Ranch as long as he wants,” Frank went
on to say; “he will always have his three meals<!-- 178.png -->
a day, and little to do. Perhaps he’s on his way
there right now. He might happen to know something
of what his son-in-law is meaning to do.”</p>

<p>Presently they drew up with a flourish alongside
the old Moqui, who allowed a faint smile of
welcome to creep over his wrinkled and bronzed
face at sight of the two lads he had come to care
for more than a little.</p>

<p>“How! Havasupai! what cheer?” cried Bob,
reaching down to shake hands.</p>

<p>“We hope you’re on your way to the ranch,
Chief,” Frank said, a little more seriously; “because
my father, the Colonel, wants to see you,
and tell you something about the one you are hunting.
Will you take a seat here behind me, and
ride?”</p>

<p>“It will be as well if Havasupai can meet the
big chief soon,” replied the old Moqui, gravely,
as he accepted Frank’s hand, and for a man of
his years deftly climbed to the withers of the buckskin
pony, that pranced about, as though not satisfied
at the prospect of carrying double.</p>

<p>“Have you any news to take him—word of the
White Wolf?” asked Frank, referring to the
rustler leader after the fashion in which the
Moqui himself had addressed him.</p>

<p>“He has left the band, and turned back, filled
with hatred for those who took his cattle out of
the valley. Even now he may be there at the<!-- 179.png -->
ranch, with a double face, meaning to have revenge
by burning the teepee of the white man or
poisoning the spring where the long-horns
drink.”</p>

<p>Frank and Bob stared at each other when the
old Moqui said this.</p>

<p>“We must make for home on the jump, Bob!”
exclaimed the stockman’s son, as he dug his heels
into the sides of his pony, and headed along the
back trail, followed by his alarmed chum.<!-- 180.png --></p>
</div>

<div id='chXX' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XX<br/>A WOLF IN SHEEP’S CLOTHING</h2>

<p>“S’pose Frank hold up—talk little ’bout White
Wolf—no need hurry!”</p>

<p>When Frank heard these words spoken in his
ear by the old Moqui he threw up his right hand,
to let Bob know he intended coming to a halt, so
that the galloping horses might not collide.</p>

<p>They had gone several miles in the direction of
the ranch house, which could even then be seen in
the far distance; with moving horsemen darting
this way and that, as the process of the rounding
up and branding the cattle went on apace.</p>

<p>“Havasupai wants to say something, Bob, and
asked me to stop,” was the way the prairie boy accounted
for his sudden change of mind.</p>

<p>The Moqui slipped from the back of Buckskin
to the ground. He was evidently considerably
tired from his long journey; but an Indian would
scorn to admit such a thing, even though near
the point of utter exhaustion. So the Moqui
looked as full of grit and determination as though
he had only started out when they came upon
him on the plain.<!-- 181.png --></p>

<p>“It may be,” he commenced to say, in his
solemn way, “that White Wolf already there, to
play part of Mexican cowboy.”</p>

<p>“Whew! we didn’t think of that, did we,
Frank?” ejaculated Bob.</p>

<p>“To tell the truth, we started off at such a
wild pace that there wasn’t time to think much
of anything,” admitted his chum.</p>

<p>“But do you believe it could be done?” persisted
Bob. “There must be cowboys working
on the Circle Ranch range who knew this
Mendoza in the past; and wouldn’t they be apt to
recognize the rustler if so be he dared come and
engage to work alongside them?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Frank replied, thoughtfully.
“A Mexican can change his looks easy enough,
you understand. We saw Mendoza in the Lost
Valley, and as I remember him, he had a mustache,
and little sideburns in front of his ears, the
way so many Mexican senors do. Suppose he
took a notion to have a clean face, why, his best
friend might pass him by, Bob.”</p>

<p>“I reckon you’re right, Frank,” replied the
other, shaking his head, as though he did not exactly
like the situation. “And now that we’re
speaking of it, I just remember that among the
extra punchers your father took on to hurry this
round-up through, there are a number of Mexicans,
who are among the best riders on the
ranges.”</p>

<p>“All right, Bob, then there’s a chance that one
of them may be Mendoza himself, if what our
friend here tells us turns out to be true, and not
a false alarm.”</p>

<p>“But would Mendoza dare risk his life in that
way, by coming back to the country where every
man’s hand is raised against him?” Bob asked,
wonderingly.</p>

<p>“They say he is a man of fierce temper, and
strong hates,” Frank continued. “I’ve heard lots
of stories about his daring. Some people choose
to call him a coward; but, bad man as he is, I
don’t believe that name fits him. And in all his
career as a cattle rustler I don’t think he ever had
such a hard knock as when we snatched all his
cattle away from him, and our boys held him
up a whole day in that bunk-house.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Bob admitted, “that sounds all right.
I can understand how angry it must make a man
like that to remember his profitable business of
helping himself to other people’s horses and
cattle has been frosted, and ruined forever in
Arizona.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you see, he must know that Circle
Ranch was responsible for it all,” Frank continued.
“And that means he hates everything
connected with our place, you and me included in
the lot. On the way to the border, where his
men intended crossing, so as to be safe from the
pursuit they expected, Mendoza has been brooding<!-- 183.png -->
over the fall of his plans, and it just set him
wild.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that sounds as if you could look in on his
camp, and see the rustler walking up and down,
saying all sorts of things to himself, and vowing
to be revenged on Circle Ranch for his downfall.
Frank, I hate to admit it, but I’m afraid Havasupai
may be right, and that the White Wolf is
already galloping over our range, roping cattle,
and mixing with our boys like one of them.”</p>

<p>“They used to say he was a cowboy once himself
years ago, and knows all the wrinkles of the
business,” Frank went on. “It gives me a shiver
just to think of that bad man being among our
fellows. Why, even before now, perhaps, he’s
found some excuse to get inside the ranch buildings,
to look around, and plan his game of setting
fire to them to-night.”</p>

<p>“But could he do that?” asked Bob, excitedly;
“when all the boys are expected to be busy with
the roping and branding; wouldn’t it look mighty
suspicious for a Mexican to be prowling around
the ranch house, where only the women folks, and
Ah Sin are left?”</p>

<p>“No matter what it would look like, a cunning
schemer like Mendoza could find a way to get
there,” Frank insisted. “Suppose now, in his
work he complained of having wrenched his arm
or shoulder, and asked to have some liniment<!-- 184.png -->
applied; don’t I just know that my dad would tell
him to gallop back to the house, and get Miss
Prue, who always looks after the little hurts of
the men, to rub on some of the famous stuff she
keeps for just that purpose?”</p>

<p>Bob gave a low whistle, to indicate how he was
affected by what his chum said.</p>

<p>“It sure takes you to see through all these
things, Frank,” he declared. “And yet I’m supposed
to be going to make a lawyer some fine
day; but they don’t seem to dawn on my mind till
after you’ve given me a hint.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s because I’ve been brought up
here,” said Frank. “I know cowboys, and their
ways, just through and through. And if Mendoza
wanted to see what the inside of the ranch
house looked like, and meet the women folks
face to face, he’d be just as apt as anything to try
some way like that. It would be easy for such
a bold man, Bob.”</p>

<p>“But what do you suppose the old warrior
wants you to hold up here for?” asked the Kentucky
boy, who could ask questions as became a
lawyer, even if he failed to grasp situations as
readily as his chum.</p>

<p>“How about that, Havasupai?” asked Frank,
as he turned to the Moqui, who had been listening
to what they said with deep earnestness.</p>

<p>“When rustlers get out of valley, and pick up<!-- 185.png -->
other ponies, Havasupai ride with same,” he said,
slowly. “Still want see Antelope, and think
White Wolf lead way to where the daughter of
the Moqui be hidden away. Then watch while
White Wolf walk up, walk down, say heap to
self, shake fist back at Thunder Mountain; then
when all rest sleep, jump on pony, and ride away
to north. Know then what in mind of bad man.
So Havasupai too leave camp, and start walk
many miles to tell Frank, Bob, look out before
blow it fall.”</p>

<p>Evidently the old Moqui believed in condensing
things, and not wasting a single word more than
was absolutely necessary. Still, while his story
left much to the imagination, even Bob could
read between the lines.</p>

<p>“Looks to me that he may be right, Frank,”
he declared, as the Indian relapsed into silence
once more, having finished his say, “if Mendoza
is really and truly playing the part of a cowboy
in the Circle Ranch grand round-up, and saw us
fetching Havasupai in on our ponies, of course
he’d know that his little game was in the soup.
That would make him furious, wouldn’t it
now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he might be tempted to do something
desperate, knowing that he’d be chased by
the whole pack of cowboys then and there. So
you see, Bob, it’s our policy, just as the Moqui<!-- 186.png -->
hints, to keep from telling Mendoza that we suspect
his presence. That gives us a chance to tell
dad, and make up some sort of plan to capture
the rustler before he can get in his bad work.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, Frank,” observed Bob, “and
I see it all now, thanks to the Moqui, first of all.
If it hadn’t been for him, I reckon you’d have
brushed right along into camp, and the fat would
have been in the fire right away. Now we’ll ride
back just as if we’d only had our gallop; and
Havasupai can come in after dark. Is that the
idea?”</p>

<p>“You’ve got it down pat there, Bob,” returned
the other; “and as the afternoon is going fast
now, perhaps we’d better be on our way back. I
feel a creepy sensation all over me every time I
think of what that rascal might do to get even
with Circle Ranch for his upset.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear what Havasupai said about
his poisoning the spring where our cattle drink?”
demanded Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps he might be ready to do such a
thing, and again not,“ Frank answered, slowly.
”I’d hate to think any man would be so mean as
that. But no matter, his being at Circle Ranch
looks like he had some scheme in his mind for
getting even, and we’ve just got to nip it in the
bud. Good-bye, then, Chief; see you later. You
come to ranch house, my father he wants to hold<!-- 187.png -->
out a helping hand to you. He believes he knows
where Antelope is; cowboy tell him. How?”</p>

<p>Almost unconsciously when Frank talked with
an Indian he adopted some of the methods of expression
in vogue among the red men. Perhaps,
like others born and brought up in close association
with these people, he believed that he could
make himself better understood this way.</p>

<p>Havasupai nodded his head, and straightened
up, as if ready to continue his wearisome tramp.
Fatigue and he were no strangers, and nothing of
this sort could in any way daunt the spirit of the
outcast.</p>

<p>“It is well, Frank;” he said, in his deep way
of speaking; “when dark come, Havasupai will
be close to ranch house, and on watch. No burn
same if can be stopped. Much good about Antelope;
know now the White Wolf bad man; never
believe Havasupai. Be glad leave him all time.
So-long.”</p>

<p>The old Moqui had at least caught the parting
sign of the range, for as he finished speaking he
waved his hand to the two boys as they let their
horses have their heads, and galloped away toward
home.</p>

<p>Looking back once, after they had gone some
little distance, Bob saw the exiled Moqui walking
leisurely along. He knew from this that Havasupai
did not wish to get within a certain distance<!-- 188.png -->
of the ranch buildings before night fell, for fear
that the cunning eyes of the Mexican rustler
might discover him.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do about it, Frank?”
demanded the Kentucky boy, as usual depending
on his chum to take the lead.</p>

<p>“First of all, let dad know,” replied Frank,
promptly.</p>

<p>“And perhaps he’ll start out to take a closer
look at every Mexican puncher on the place?”
suggested Bob. “Say, won’t there just be some
‘high jinks’ when he finds Mendoza, and accuses
him of wanting to burn the buildings, or
something about as bad? Whew, the Mexican
will be some surprised when he learns his mask
is snatched off; eh, Frank?”</p>

<p>“All the same I don’t believe dad will do anything
like that,” was the reply the other made.
“In the first place, it would be dangerous.
Father would be likely to hold back, just to see
what the game of Mendoza might be.”</p>

<p>“Oh! now I get on to what you mean!” exclaimed
Bob; “in legal language, or as the police
would say, he’d be better satisfied to catch him
with the goods, trying to set a fire, for instance.
And let me say, Frank, your father would show
what you’d call good, sound, horse sense if he
did let the fellow have rope that way. But say,
I hope he tells a few of the boys. I’d feel safer<!-- 189.png -->
if we had enough fellows handy to stop Mendoza,
when he starts to get ugly.”</p>

<p>“Depend on it he will, Bob. Dad never takes
chances on such things. He’s handled too many
deals with tough customers to think of going
to sleep. But we’re getting close in now, and
we’d better act natural. If you look around at
every Mexican we happen to meet, don’t be too
suspicious. Try and forget that we suspect a
snake is warming himself at the Circle Ranch fires
this evening.”</p>

<p>“All right, Frank,” replied the other, cheerfully.
“I’m on to what you say, and don’t worry
about my giving it away. But the work is through
for to-day; because I can see the boys gathering
in bunches while they wait for Ah Sin to beat the
gong for supper. But I want to be with you
when you tell your father the story, Frank.”</p>
</div>

<div id='chXXI' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br/>SETTING THE TRAP</h2>

<p>Just as Bob had remarked, the hard work of
the first day of the grand round-up seemed to be
done. The cowboys had taken their wearied
mounts to the corral, and were themselves gathering
in little knots, to talk over the exciting events
marking the start of the regular Fall clean-up.</p>

<p>It promised to be a banner year for Circle
Ranch. There were half again as many young
cattle to brand with the well known ring, designed
to stamp them as the property of Colonel
Haywood. Besides, the main herd had wintered
better the preceding year than for a long time;
there had been less loss through wolves, and
the depredations of rustlers; and, to cap the
climax, many unclaimed cows and steers had fallen
to the colonel, after his raid on Lost Valley.</p>

<p>All these things made everybody feel “bully,”
as the cow punchers themselves expressed it.
And as Frank and Bob passed group after group
they could see that, tired as the workers must be,
this feeling was constantly cropping out.</p>

<p>“Nobody seems to think of anything like<!-- 191.png -->
danger right now,” said Bob, in a low tone, as
they passed a bunch of the wild riders, among
whom were several dark-faced Mexicans.</p>

<p>“I should say not,” echoed his chum. “You
see they believe our friend Mendoza is across the
border before now, and likely to stay on Mexican
soil for some time, if he knows what’s good for
his health.”</p>

<p>“Did you notice that fellow on the outskirts
of the bunch; and how he turned deliberately
around to look at us when we rode past?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“Sure,” came the quick reply, “but if we
didn’t know what we did, I reckon neither of us
would have thought it queer for him to do that.
If he’s a stranger here, as seems likely, it would
be only natural for him to look, when one of the
others remarked that the colonel’s son was coming.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you there, Frank; but seeing that
we <i>do</i> know something, don’t you admit that there
was something suspicious in the quick way he
turned? For my part, I only gave him one peep
as I waved my hand to the lot; but that seemed
to tell me he was frowning to beat the band.
How?”</p>

<p>“Just what he was, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Then you noticed that too, did you?” demanded
the Kentucky boy, eagerly.<!-- 192.png --></p>

<p>“No question about it; and three to one that
fellow is no other that the rustler who’s been
such a nuisance around here for several years,”
Frank replied.</p>

<p>Bob whistled, as was his usual fashion when
surprised.</p>

<p>“But think of his nerve, would you, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Oh! they say he’s got more than his share
of that, all right,” chuckled his chum, as they
headed toward the horse corral, to leave their
mounts in the care of the man who had charge
there.</p>

<p>“Some of these punchers must have known
him; he used to be on a ranch once, I’m told,”
Bob went on.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Frank, slowly, “but it was
years ago that he broke loose, and took to an
easier way of getting a herd than raising cattle.
Besides, you must remember we agreed he would
shave his face clean, to start with. That must
make a big change in any Mexican. And he can
keep his hat well down over his eyes. Last of
all, he relies on the fact that nobody dreams he
would take such risks as to come here right
now.”</p>

<p>After leaving their horses, the boys headed
straight for the ranch house, where they asked
for Colonel Haywood.</p>

<p>It chanced that he was in his business office,
in consultation with the overseer, which fact
pleased Frank; since Bart Heminway would have
to be put in touch with the truth concerning the
presence of the notorious rustler at the Circle
Ranch round-up.</p>

<p>The stockman looked up as the lads entered,
and smiled.</p>

<p>“Back from your little gallop, eh?” he remarked;
for he had seen them starting forth, and
wondered at the powers of endurance shown by
both boys and horses; for they had been pretty
busy all that stirring day.</p>

<p>“Yes, Dad, and with some news that will make
you sit up and take notice, I reckon,” replied
Frank, after glancing around, to make sure there
was no chance of his being overheard by way of
the open window.</p>

<p>Bob had, by arrangement, stepped over, and
taken up his position where he could occasionally
thrust his head outside a window and in this way
make sure no listener was crouching near the wall
of the building.</p>

<p>“Now you have me guessing, son,” remarked
the stockman.</p>

<p>“Three to one it’s something about that
Mendoza!” exclaimed the overseer, who had
never ceased to lament the fact that they had
allowed the rustler to escape so easily.</p>

<p>From the fact of Bob laughing at this chance<!-- 194.png -->
remark, the stockman realized that Bart had
hit pretty close to the line.</p>

<p>“What about him now, Frank?” he asked.</p>

<p>“He didn’t cross the boundary after all, Dad,”
said the boy. “Fact is, he’s come back to this
region, bent on getting his revenge for what the
Circle Ranch outfit did to knock his game to
flinders.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get this interesting news,
son?” asked the other, frowning; for well he
knew that it meant trouble of some sort.</p>

<p>“We happened to run across that old Moqui,
Havasupai, when we were riding just now. He
was about tired out, but bent on getting to the
ranch house some time to-night. He told us that
after riding off many miles to the south with his
men, Mendoza had slipped away, and headed
back this way.”</p>

<p>“But Frank, how did the Indian know what the
rustler had in mind?”</p>

<p>“I think he overheard a talk between Mendoza
and one of his men,” the boy replied. “The
rustler was angry at the slick way we shut him up
that day, and walked all his cattle off, as well as
our own. He said he was going to pay you up, if
it was the last thing he ever did. And, dad, I
reckon he’s right here now, in the thick of the
round-up, ready to strike before another morning!”</p>

<p>Colonel Haywood and his overseer exchanged
glances.</p>

<p>“Oh! he’s ekal to it, Colonel,” declared Bart.
“When I think of the bold games that fellar has
engineered through all these years, and the way
he gave us the merry laugh every time we hunted
him, I’m ready to admit he’d be ready to drop in
whar fifty enemies was gathered, and make
b’lieve he was one of ’em. And thar’s sure several
Mexican ropers along I never set eyes on
before. Just as like as not one of ’em might be
Mendoza.”</p>

<p>“Did the Moqui know what sort of revenge
this fellow expected to take, Frank?” the stockman
continued, uneasily.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether he was only guessing,
or knew about it,” replied the boy; “but he said
something about his poisoning the spring-hole
where most of our cattle drink; or else burning
the building, while all of us were sleeping!”</p>

<p>“Either one would be bad enough,” declared
the stockman; “but now that we have been forewarned
it’ll have to be a clever man who can accomplish
such a game.”</p>

<p>“What will you do, dad?” asked Frank,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“First of all, put a guard over the spring, who
will remain in hiding, with orders to shoot down
any man seen to be tampering with the water,
especially if he looks like a Mexican,” replied the
rancher, firmly.</p>

<p>“And about burning the buildings?” continued
Frank.</p>

<p>“I’ll make sure to be ready for him here,”
the stockman continued. “It would please me
first class to catch the house-burner in the act.
Of course, now that we believe Mendoza is here
for some evil purpose, we could jump on him
without warning. That might suit most people;
but it’s always been my plan to let a rascal go
the length of his rope before nabbing him.”</p>

<p>“I told Bob that, Dad,” remarked Frank.
“But will you let all the boys in on the game?”</p>

<p>“Not at all, Frank. I might tell several who
can be trusted to keep a still tongue in their heads;
for we shall need a certain amount of help here
to watch the house on all sides, and get the fellow
just as he strikes his match. Old Hank Coombs
came in just before you did, and is around. Of
course I shall count on him, as well as on Ted
Conway, Scotty and Jeff Davis.”</p>

<p>“But you will let us sit up with the bunch,
Dad; after bringing in the news you wouldn’t shut
us off, would you?” Frank asked.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t seem right, I admit, after all the
good work you two boys have done,” remarked
the stockman; “though you’ll have to promise to
hold back, and let some of the husky men do the<!-- 197.png -->
actual hard work. I can’t afford to take the
chances of my boys getting hurt by such a desperate
rascal.”</p>

<p>Of course both of them readily promised, and
after some further conversation Frank and his
chum hurried out. The coming of Old Hank
Coombs to the ranch was an event that greatly
pleased Frank. Much that he knew about life in
the open had come through the kindly instruction
of the veteran cow puncher and hunter; and the
boy could look back to many a happy night spent
with old Hank beside a fire somewhere out on
the plains, or in the mountains.</p>

<p>Circle Ranch was a bustling hive just then.
Scores of strangers were apt to visit the place during
the several days that the drive and the round-up
were on, interested in the great event. Men
representing big papers and magazines in the East
had come to see how these things were conducted;
for the stock raising business in the Southwest was
soon going into a decline, because farms were being
taken up everywhere, under the wonderful
new system of irrigation that was being put into
practice in many localities.</p>

<p>After supper there was heard the sound of
merry music. Some of the boys played the mandolin
or banjo; others sang; and a few even tried
to dance with their customary vigor, though
weariness compelled them to speedily abandon
this form of hilarity.<!-- 198.png --></p>

<p>Colonel Haywood had carried out all his quickly-laid
plans for the campaign, looking to the arrest
of the rustler. He had sent a reliable
man to the spring-hole where the cattle drank,
with strict orders as to what he should do if anyone
came and acted suspiciously during the night.
No mercy was to be shown a man who would descend
to such a pass as to try and poison an entire
herd of cattle, just to have revenge on the
man who had broken up his unlawful trade.</p>

<p>Bart Heminway talked to the four cowboys
wanted at the house, and they had managed to
slip indoors. They were now waiting to be placed
on their several stations by the stockman, who exhibited
some of the qualities of a general in managing
his affairs.</p>

<p>The saddle boys had taken up their position
in a spot close to Ted Conway and Old Hank. In
figuring out just where the intended attack might
come, this particular place had been deemed first
choice. The direction of the night wind convinced
Colonel Haywood that a shrewd man who
wished to fire the buildings would be apt to select
it as his starting point.</p>

<p>It was a dark night, too, despite the fact that
there was supposed to be a moon back of the
heavy clouds which covered the heavens.</p>

<p>Once having taken up their position, Frank and
Bob knew that they must remain as still as a cat
watching for a mouse to show at a hole in the<!-- 199.png -->
flooring. There was no telling when the enemy
might appear. After having started the blaze, if
that proved the intention of the rustler, he would
have his plans laid to gallop madly away on the
freshest horse in the corral, and thus laugh at
pursuit.</p>

<p>Tired after the labors of that wonderful day,
the cowboys had sought their bunks sooner than
usual. By ten o’clock all had become silent
around the place. Here and there a fire smouldered,
past which an occasional figure might be
seen to shuffle; or it might be a dog wandering
around, looking for bones.</p>

<p>Frank and Bob lay close, never moving a
muscle, though to the latter it was indeed hard
work. An hour, two of them, had crept along,
and nothing happened. Bob even began to
wonder whether after all there might not be some
mistake; or whether the rustler’s nerve had failed
him in the pinch.</p>

<p>Then he felt a slight nudge in the region of his
ribs, that came from Frank’s elbow. This
warned him that his keen-eared chum had caught
some suspicious movement close by. Perhaps the
rustler was coming, bent on carrying out his
scheme of firing the buildings belonging to Circle
Ranch! Bob held his breath, and waited to see
what would speedily happen.<!-- 200.png --></p>
</div>

<div id='chXXII' class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br/>CAUGHT IN THE ACT—CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>That crackling sound which came to Bob’s
strained ears he knew must mean that a match
had been struck. Yes, he could see the sudden
little glow; and even managed to catch a view of
a dark face hovering over some fuel that the
would-be fire-bug had carried with him to the spot.</p>

<p>This immediately flashed into flame, indicating
that Mendoza, in order in make sure of a good
start, had soaked the material with some inflammable
substance; perhaps kerosene.</p>

<p>Bob knew that something was apt to happen
about that time; nor was he at all mistaken. He
saw a dark figure drop down upon the crouching
fire-bug, and heard a startled exclamation. Then
the two men went whirling over the ground,
locked in a close embrace.</p>

<p>“This way, Bob!” cried Frank, rushing forward
to stamp out the rapidly spreading flames;
for that work had been given over to their
charge. “Old Hank will help Ted! Kick lively
now, and scatter the fire!”</p>

<p>They worked at a furious rate, and soon had
the flames under control. Others had meanwhile
come dashing to the spot—Scotty, Jeff Davis,
Bart, the foreman, and last, though far from
least, the stockman himself.</p>

<p>Old Hank Coombs had taken a hand in the
game, and Mendoza was speedily overcome,
though he writhed and squirmed to the last uttering
harsh words intended for the owner of the
ranch.</p>

<p>“What will they do with him, Frank?” asked
Bob, as he saw signs that indicated a general outpouring
of the cowboy legion from the nearby
bunk-house, and other places where the overflow
had been lodged.</p>

<p>Even Bob realized that if ever these furious
fellows laid hands on Mendoza he would meet
with a swift fate, which, perhaps, he well deserved,
as he had long been the pest of the border,
and a thorn in the sides of all cattle raisers.</p>

<p>“Dad will do everything in his power to hold
the boys quiet,” Frank answered. “See, he’s
telling Hank and Ted to take him right inside the
house; and there he’ll be kept. I understood
Dad to say he’d sent word to the sheriff to come
around with a posse in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh! then perhaps Mendoza will get a chance
to work a few years in the penitentiary, after
all,” remarked Bob.<!-- 202.png --></p>

<p>“He will, if the sheriff ever gets him to town
safe,” replied Frank, doubtfully.</p>

<p>Of course the whole place was filled with excitement
by this time. The women in the house
had been awakened by the noise; but accustomed
to all sorts of alarms, they calmly waited to be
told what it meant. Those who live on cattle
ranches meet with so much bordering on danger,
that they learn to control their nerves; and this
applies to women as well as men.</p>

<p>Some of the boys demanded that the rustler be
given over into their hands, and promised that
he would never “rustle” any cattle again. To
this, however, the owner of Circle Ranch gave a
negative answer.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he deserves all you would give him,
boys,” he announced, when they came clamoring
for Mendoza; “but, fortunately, we were able to
nip his miserable scheme in the bud, and no
damage was done. So, as the sheriff of the county
will be here in the morning, I expect to turn
him over, and see that he gets a long term. And
remember, boys,” he added, seriously; “it would
be a dangerous thing for anybody to try and enter
this house to-night.”</p>

<p>They knew what he meant, and that when Colonel
Haywood spoke in that vein he was not to be
taken lightly. Though there was more or less
grumbling, still the remainder of that night passed<!-- 203.png -->
away without any disturbance. No doubt
Mendoza, having had a chance to cool down, and
repent of his rashness, was glad to see the break
of early dawn.</p>

<p>The sheriff did come, along about noon, while
the cowboys were partaking of their midday meal.
And knowing what a task he might have before
him, he brought a large posse of deputies along,
in order to protect his prisoner.</p>

<p>The last the saddle boys saw of the Mexican
rustler, he was galloping off between several
heavily armed riders, and laughing mockingly at
the crowd that gathered to see him depart.</p>

<p>The stockman did all in his power to keep any
of his employers from deserting the round-up, in
order to try and wrest the prisoner away from
his guards; and so successful were his efforts that
Mendoza was landed in the lock-up. It might be
said of him that in due time he received the reward
of his crimes, and was sent to the penitentiary
for a long term. Unless he should manage to
escape at some time, the cattlemen of the Southwest
can breathe easy for years to come; for the
rustler will, in all probability, never be seen again.</p>

<p>The old Moqui had arrived at the ranch about
midnight. Indeed, he was just in time to see the
capture of the man who had caused him so much
mental suffering in connection with his one daughter,
Antelope.<!-- 204.png --></p>

<p>Colonel Haywood was not the one to forget a
promise he had made; and as soon as the grand
round-up was a thing of the past he set to work
trying to find where Mendoza had hidden his
Moqui wife.</p>

<p>As one of the cattlemen had been able to give
him a hint concerning this, success greeted the
efforts of the ranchman before long. Havasupai
was enabled to once more claim his daughter.</p>

<p>He could not return to his village, for there
was a perpetual edict of banishment issued against
him; so, as the stockman offered him a chance to
remain at Circle Ranch, and be entered on the
regular payroll as a scout, hunter, and tracker of
lost cattle, Havasupai settled down to his new
life.</p>

<p>The boys were glad of this, since both of them
had taken a decided liking to the old Indian. And
Hank Coombs struck up a close friendship with
Havasupai, they having many interests in common.</p>

<p>On the very day after the grand round-up had
closed, with Circle Ranch resuming its ordinary
aspect, the saddle boys started out on what everybody
supposed was simply a hunt for fresh venison;
or a chance to pot some daring wolf found
abroad in the daytime. But Bob had another mission
on his mind.</p>

<p>“Oh! I hope I find it there, Frank,” he said<!-- 205.png -->
for the fourth time, as later on they drew rapidly
near a <i>motte</i> of timber that marked some spring-hole,
miles away from the ranch proper.</p>

<p>“Well, I give you my word I wish it just as
much as you can do,” chuckled the other, giving
his chum a meaning look.</p>

<p>“I suppose I have bothered you a heap, Frank,
what with my guessing, and asking all sorts of
silly questions,” Bob went on; “but if you only
knew how much I think of that knife you wouldn’t
be surprised.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m not blaming you, Bob, not a bit of
it,” laughed the other. “I was only thinking of
that dream you had, and wondering if it could
come out true, with the knife sticking in that tree
just as you saw it while asleep. If it does turn
out that way, why, I’ll believe your spirit must
have wandered out here while your body lay
there alongside me. But in a few minutes now
you’ll know the worst.”</p>

<p>“Say the best, Frank!” cried Bob. “Don’t
discourage me, right now, when you can see how
I’m keyed up to top-notch pace.”</p>

<p>“There’s where you crept up on the deer, and
fired,” Frank remarked, pointing.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I can follow the track I took into
the timber, every foot of it,” Bob called back
over his shoulder; for in his eagerness he was outstripping
his chum, though Frank was content to<!-- 206.png -->
have it so. “But seeing that I cut up the deer, as
you said, I couldn’t have lost the knife beforehand,
that’s sure!”</p>

<p>“Well, there you are; and I can see the trees
at the foot of which the buck dropped. Hold
your breath now, Bob, and wish hard you’re going
to find the lost blade.”</p>

<p>The Kentucky lad drew his big black horse up
sharply, and with a bound was out of the saddle.
Frank, who had also come to a sudden stop, saw
him glance around eagerly, while a look of bitter
disappointment flashed across his face.</p>

<p>“Your dream—remember that it was around
in the crotch of the tree you saw it, Bob! Feel
there, and see!” cried Frank.</p>

<p>The other hastened to do so. Immediately a
yell broke from his lips, and Frank saw him bring
forth a knife that had been lodged in the crotch.</p>

<p>“Found!” shouted Bob, beginning to dance
around the place in his great satisfaction. “Now
after this I’m going to believe there may be something
in dreams, aren’t you, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Shucks!” laughed the other, “chances are
you just partly remembered putting it up there,
and the fact appealed to you while you slept, that’s
all. If a small part of the silly dreams I’ve had
ever came true, I’d be in hot water all the time.
Where one happens to hit the mark, fifty fall
down. But I’m glad you’ve got that knife again.”</p>

<p>The Fall round-up was over, and had been a
great success. Circle Ranch had done far better
than any year since it was started, and could
easily be set down as the banner cattle raising
combination in the whole State. Then, besides,
there was the wonderful success that had resulted
from the effort to rid the community of Mendoza,
the rustler. From now on peace would hang over
the cattle ranches from the Grand Canyon of the
Colorado down to the Mexican border.</p>

<p>The saddle boys had many adventures still
awaiting them, and what some of these were
will be related in another volume, entitled:
“The Saddle Boys on Mexican Trails; Or, In
the Hands of the Enemy.”</p>

<p>Impulsive Bob, the Kentucky lad, still has
much to learn about Western ways; but with such
a chum as Frank Haywood to show him the
secrets of forest, plain and trail, he at least bids
fair to, in time, become well versed in the accomplishments
that mark the true son of the wilderness.
Until such time as perhaps we may once
more gallop in the company of the saddle boys
we will say to our young readers, good-bye.</p>
